<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />Peril in Paradise</h2>
<p>In the tropical, jungle-like garden behind the hotel, a
man stood absolutely motionless. The broad trunk of
the coconut palm tree behind which he lurked protected
him from being seen by anyone on the hotel&rsquo;s
wide, sweeping porch.</p>
<p>The tense set of the man&rsquo;s features showed his
growing impatience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>The broad porch ran around all four sides of the
white, sprawling Royal Poinciana Hotel on Waikiki
Beach, in Honolulu, Hawaii. The porch was called
the &ldquo;deck,&rdquo; and it had been designed to resemble the
promenade deck of an ocean liner. It was an open
porch, or deck, with brightly colored floral-patterned
umbrellas spreading welcome shade. The deck was
spotted with lounge and captain&rsquo;s chairs, and its teak-wood
floor was marked off at regular intervals with
shuffleboard courts.</p>
<p>The fore deck, that part of the porch running
across the front of the hotel, overlooked the beautiful
beach and its rolling, coiling breakers. Chairs and tables
scattered on it were occupied by people waiting
for the noon meal. On the rear deck, overlooking the
carefully planned, luxuriant jungle-garden, only one
couple could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they never leave?&rdquo; the man muttered to himself.
He looked at his watch, then carefully peered
around the tree, looking up at the deck jutting out
from the hotel&rsquo;s second floor.</p>
<p>Just as he did so, the couple got up from their
chairs and walked leisurely away, heading for the
other side. The man waited until they rounded a corner
and were out of sight. Then he moved swiftly.</p>
<p>His linen-clad figure was a white flash against broad
green leaves as he dashed for the steps leading up to
the now unoccupied porch. Once on the deck, he
moved casually, as though he were just another tourist.
He walked softly on crepe-soled shoes, making
not a sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Nearing the center of the porch, the man pressed
his back against the white-painted wall, almost blending
into it except for his dark, swarthy face. Now he
moved sidewise, crab-like, until he reached a partly
opened latticed door. He stopped, pressing his head
against the slight crack where the door was hinged.</p>
<p>Moments passed. Then he heard the sharp jangling
sound of a telephone ringing from within the room
beyond. Next he heard the soft pad of feet on thick
piled carpet as the room&rsquo;s occupant crossed the floor
to take the call.</p>
<p>Now the prowler abandoned his extreme caution.
He looked through the partly opened door. He saw
the back of a man sitting at a telephone table. The
prowler carefully pulled the door open and slipped
into the room. Its occupant had the phone&rsquo;s receiver
to his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your call to Mr. Thomas Brewster in Indianapolis,
Indiana, sir,&rdquo; the operator was saying, &ldquo;they
are ringing that number now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prowler crept closer until he was within an
arm&rsquo;s length of the seated man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man said into the telephone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold
the line.&rdquo; With his free hand he pulled a well-used
pipe from his jacket pocket and stuck it in his mouth.
Then he patted the table for matches. He opened a
drawer and felt in it.</p>
<p>The prowler watched his prey anxiously. He was
an old man, with shaggy white hair hanging down
almost to his collar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Unable to find a match, the old man had just started
to turn when the operator spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Honolulu, Hawaii, calling Mr. Thomas
Brewster,&rdquo; she said. A few seconds passed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
your party, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prowler stood there, arms raised, the fingers
of his cupped hands spread like talons just over the
old man&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />A Disturbing Call</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of eleven-year-old Monica Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always do,&rdquo; grumbled her twin brother Ted.
&ldquo;I never do get to answer the telephone. Not when
<i>you&rsquo;re</i> in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Monica wasn&rsquo;t listening. She was flying into the
kitchen to answer the steady ring before her mother
could lift the phone from its cradle. Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s
study was nearer, and there was a telephone in there,
too. But Monica knew that her father was in the
study, talking to her older brother Biff. She was sure
the call was from her friend Betsy, because Betsy
generally called her about five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
Monica didn&rsquo;t want her father interrupting her
talk with Betts. Daddy didn&rsquo;t approve of long phone
gabs.</p>
<p>Moments later, Monica came bursting through the
living room. Her excitement was at a pitch as high as
her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy! Daddy! The call&rsquo;s from Honolulu! Someone&rsquo;s
calling you from Honolulu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, sis, or you&rsquo;ll explode.&rdquo; Biff grinned
as he saw the eagerness on his sister&rsquo;s flushed face.</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster picked up the telephone. He listened
briefly, then cupped his hand over the mouthpiece
and spoke to his older son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the door, Biff. <i>Behind</i> your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff got up from his chair and gently ushered Monica,
protesting, out of the study. When he turned
back, he was startled to see that an expression of
worry clouded his father&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johann, I agree.&rdquo; Mr. Brewster gave the
name its Germanic pronunciation, &ldquo;<i>Yohann</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff could only distinguish a mumble of words
coming from nearly four thousand miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Johann, don&rsquo;t you take any chances yourself,&rdquo;
Mr. Brewster continued. &ldquo;Wait until I get there....
Danger? There&rsquo;s always danger when the stakes
are as high as those we&rsquo;re playing for.... What!&rdquo;
Thomas Brewster&rsquo;s frown deepened. &ldquo;Perez Soto?
You say Perez Soto is there? I don&rsquo;t like that one
little bit. The letter, though, you have that safely hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Again the speaker at the other end took over the
conversation. Biff could hear only a scramble of
sounds coming from the telephone. He saw his father
nod his head absently. His brows knitted into deeper
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think your room was searched?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Had you hidden the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff watched his father intently. Mr. Brewster listened
attentively to a long reply. At last he said,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad, Johann. Very bad. We&rsquo;ll have to make
the best of it, though. All right, Johann.... Yes,
leaving here tomorrow ... Northwest Airlines....
Take off from Seattle early the next morning,
Wednesday, at five <span class="sc">A.M.</span> Be in Hawaii about eight
o&rsquo;clock your time.... You&rsquo;re stopping at the Royal
Poinciana, aren&rsquo;t you?... Hello ... hello ... Johann?&rdquo;
Thomas Brewster waited a few moments.
&ldquo;Hello....&rdquo; Then he hung up and turned to Biff.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny. He didn&rsquo;t answer. Maybe we were cut
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the three minutes were up,&rdquo; Biff suggested
with a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not as funny as you think, my boy,&rdquo; his father
chuckled. &ldquo;Dr. Weber&rsquo;s a peculiar man about
some things having to do with money. A call from
Honolulu to Indianapolis means nothing to him. But
if the operator told him his three minutes were up,
he&rsquo;d hang up quickly. He obeys what he thinks are the
rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff laughed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Dr. Weber the famous scientist?
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve heard you speak of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff. He&rsquo;s a staff consultant for Ajax.
I&rsquo;ve worked with him before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head. &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster was the chief field engineer for
the Ajax Mining Company, headquarters Indianapolis,
Indiana. His job took him all over the world, to many
of the strangest and least known spots on the globe.
Whenever it was possible, he took sixteen-year-old
Biff along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my reasons for going to Hawaii is to meet
Dr. Weber,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father continued now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the Engineers&rsquo; Conference isn&rsquo;t the
main reason?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster shook his head. &ldquo;No. Oh, the
meeting is important, all right. But I doubt if I would
have gone out there for that alone. Dr. Weber wrote
me over a month ago. Said he wanted to meet with
me and Jim Huntington. He said it was very important.
But he didn&rsquo;t go into details. I imagine he
didn&rsquo;t want to put too much information on paper.
Afraid it might be seen by eyes other than my own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Biff was thinking. &ldquo;It seems to me, Dad, that I&rsquo;ve
heard you mention this Mr. Huntington before, too.
Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. I hadn&rsquo;t heard from Huntington for a
long, long time. But he did some work for me in the
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, Dad? And what was all that
about a letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster sighed. &ldquo;Oh, the letter. Forget
you <i>ever</i> heard about it. Dr. Weber told me Jim
Huntington was lost at sea sailing up to Hawaii from
New Zealand. Got caught in a terrific storm, and his
sloop sank. He was able to send a radio signal of his
position, but Weber said a sea and air search has failed,
so far, to discover any trace of Huntington or his
sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s really too bad. Do you know why he
wanted to see you and Dr. Weber?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea. And if what I think is true, then
Jim Huntington&rsquo;s loss is a very real one for the whole
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you mention there might be danger&mdash;&rdquo;
Biff stopped. A spark of excitement flashed across his
face. His blue eyes lighted up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger, Biff? Well, we&rsquo;ve been in tight spots before.
You, in China, and with me in Brazil.&rdquo; Tom
Brewster paused, then said slowly, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always
an element of danger in the work we do for Ajax.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Biff, his face serious, nodded his head. He was
thinking of Hawaii, our fiftieth state. What danger
could there be there?</p>
<p class="tb">The telephone operator at the Royal Poinciana Hotel
on Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, looked up as her
luncheon relief came into her small room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi. Am I ever glad to see you! I&rsquo;m just about
starved. I&rsquo;m on a diet. Not for much longer, though.
Hey, something funny&rsquo;s going on. That old gent in
suite 210. Made a stateside call just now and didn&rsquo;t
hang up when he finished. Imagine! He left the phone
off the hook. I&rsquo;ll tell a bellboy to hop up there when
I go out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />Worried Twins</h2>
<p>Although he didn&rsquo;t want to show it, eleven-year-old
Ted Brewster was just as excited as his sister over the
call from Honolulu. He slipped quietly over to the
door of the study. He wanted to know what the call
was all about. He got there just in time to see Monica
ushered firmly out as Biff closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it, sis?&rdquo; Ted demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Monica shook her head. &ldquo;It was
just the operator saying she had a call from Honolulu
for Mr. Thomas Brewster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go out and hang up the phone in the
kitchen,&rdquo; Ted ordered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Monica left the room and returned almost immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t listen in?&rdquo; Ted asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course not! I have very excellent manners. No
lady would listen in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; Ted sneered. &ldquo;<i>You</i>, a lady? A &rsquo;leven-year-old-lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m older than you,&rdquo; Monica replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes older. Call that older? I don&rsquo;t. And
don&rsquo;t tell me you never listen in. How &rsquo;bout yesterday?
When I was talking to Peteso? I suppose you
didn&rsquo;t try to listen in then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. You&rsquo;re only a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kid!&rdquo; This was too much. &ldquo;And what about
you? You think you&rsquo;re so grown up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twins glared at one another. Then, without
any reason, glares suddenly turned to smiles, followed
by unexplained, uncontrolled laughter. Neither one
of the twins could stay angry very long. When their
giggles died away, they strained their ears toward the
study door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is a long call,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;Hope nothing&rsquo;s
gone wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone wrong? What could go wrong, Ted?&rdquo;
Monica&rsquo;s voice showed her concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I sure hope that call doesn&rsquo;t
mean we&rsquo;re not going to Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Now Monica was really worried. &ldquo;Golly, I just
couldn&rsquo;t bear it. Not to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too. Biff gets to go everywhere. When do I
get to go anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two sat in silence, thinking how cruel the
world was to eleven-year-olds. The Brewsters&rsquo; summer
cottage on Vineyard Lake&mdash;that was nothing.
Their speed boat and water skis, they seemed like
nothing, too. And their Christmas trip to Florida,
visiting their grandparents&mdash;what were all those
things compared to going to Hawaii? They had been
to many places in continental United States, but neither
of the twins had ever been out of the country. Well,
even if Hawaii was now part of the U.S., they preferred
to think they were going to an exotic new
land.</p>
<p>That was why, when their father had told them
just a week before he was going to take the whole
family with him to Hawaii, the twins&rsquo; joy knew no
limits.</p>
<p>They had known their father was going to Hawaii
for a three weeks&rsquo; stay. He was to attend an international
conference of mining engineers. He was even
going to deliver one of the most important speeches
at the meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Biff Brewster was the oldest of the three Brewster
children. He had gone with his father on several of
his explorations. But Biff was sixteen, an age Ted
could hardly wait to reach. Biff even had his driver&rsquo;s
license. To Ted, this was the highest goal anybody
could hope to reach.</p>
<p>The Brewster family had been having a cookout
in their backyard when Mr. Brewster made his wonderful
announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more week, and it&rsquo;s off to Hawaii,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Biff going?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>The children&rsquo;s father had smiled and turned to Mrs.
Brewster. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pack the small fry and take them
along, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; whooped Ted, his hot dog hitting the
grass and his lemonade spilling all over his shorts as
he leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me? Me? I&rsquo;m going, too!&rdquo; Monica hurled
herself at her father, her arms circling his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy there, princess. I&rsquo;d rather have this food inside
me, not on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster put his daughter down. He
looked into her eager, upturned face. Her hazel eyes
sparkled. She had never looked prettier to him, and
Mr. Brewster had always thought her the fairest princess
of them all. Copper-colored hair framed her
oval, pixie face. The summer sun had bronzed her
clear skin. Keeping up with her brother Ted had
given her a straight, sturdy figure. A nuisance at
times, when her spirits shot higher than Pike&rsquo;s Peak,
she was the darling of the family, and had to be
squelched only three or four times a week.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about it, Ted?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said teasingly.
&ldquo;Think your sister ought to come along, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Dad. Sure.&rdquo; was the quick reply. Monica
flashed a loving look at her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you say so. Okay by you, Mother?
And you, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;re all going?&rdquo; A look of disbelief
crossed Mrs. Brewster&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Time we all had a vacation together.
I won&rsquo;t be too busy at this meeting. And I&rsquo;m sure
we&rsquo;d all like to visit our fiftieth state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff followed his father&rsquo;s words without speaking.
He surely felt good, though, about what his father
was saying. Biff knew how envious his brother and
sister were of the trips he had made. This time, they
were going along, too. The whole family! They&rsquo;d
have a swell time. Dad was really tops.</p>
<p>A smile softened Biff&rsquo;s strong-featured face. His
blue-gray eyes lighted up. He moved off the deck
chair where he was sprawled and walked over to
drape an arm over his mother&rsquo;s shoulders. He was
taller than his mother, with broad, square shoulders.
For a sixteen-year-old, Biff was big and husky. He
had to be, to have come out of his many adventures
unharmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be swell, Mom!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dad couldn&rsquo;t
have done anything to make Ted and Monnie happier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, looking at his father&rsquo;s worried face, Biff
wondered if the call from Dr. Weber might mean
a change in plans. He hoped not. Not only for his
own sake, but for his brother&rsquo;s and sister&rsquo;s. It would
be a wonderful rest and vacation for Mother, too.
Biff wished he knew more about his father&rsquo;s real reason
for the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, will that call make any difference about
your taking us on the trip with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; his father said slowly. &ldquo;Dr. Weber&rsquo;s
call puts the whole trip in a new light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, Dad, Ted&rsquo;s and Monica&rsquo;s hearts would be
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Brewster stood up. He went to the door
without replying. When he opened it, his two
younger children swarmed all over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That call from Honolulu? What was it about?&rdquo;
Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, tell us!&rdquo; chirped Monica.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brewster had entered the room. She looked
at her husband questioningly.</p>
<p>The twins looked at their father. He ruffled Ted&rsquo;s
hair and patted Monica on the cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still going, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Monica said in a
small, hopeful voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess.... Yes, we sure are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squeals of delight filled the air. But Mrs. Brewster,
reading the expression on her husband&rsquo;s face, knew
that the trip was no longer just a pleasure jaunt for
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />Aloha!</h2>
<p>The blue waters of the Pacific Ocean, fourteen thousand
feet below, sparkled under the slanting rays of
the rising sun. Sleepy-eyed passengers aboard the
Northwest airliner yawned, stretched, and brought
their reclining seats to an upright position. Two stewardesses
hurried back and forth along the aisle of the
plane, carrying breakfast trays of chilled pineapple
juice, slices of golden yellow papaya, and steaming
coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The younger members of the Brewster family,
Biff and the twins, had been awake from the time of
take-off, although their mother had insisted they try
to rest. Mr. and Mrs. Brewster still lay stretched out
with their chairs in a reclining position, but now they
showed signs of coming out of their fitful sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer, Biff? How long till we get
there? You&rsquo;ve been to Honolulu before,&rdquo; Monica
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for a short stopover on my way to Burma,&rdquo;
Biff replied. He looked at his watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say we
ought to be there in an hour. Maybe a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Brewster family had boarded the plane at six
o&rsquo;clock that morning, their flight having been delayed
on take-off for an hour by a low-hanging bank
of fog. The big plane&rsquo;s four jet engines and a favorable
tailwind had pushed it through the sky at a speed
of over 600 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster leaned over the seat in front of
him where Ted and Monica were fussing in low tones
over whose turn it was to sit next to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, you&rsquo;re surely wide awake for such an early
hour!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early? Gee, Dad, it&rsquo;s after ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Ted replied,
looking at his wrist watch.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster laughed. &ldquo;Guess Ted doesn&rsquo;t know
about setting his watch back. You set yours right,
Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, set my watch back?&rdquo; Ted
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Difference in time, Ted. With daylight-saving
time further complicating matters, it&rsquo;s three hours
earlier in Hawaii than it is in Seattle. So, if your
watch says ten, then it&rsquo;s only seven o&rsquo;clock in Honolulu.
People are just getting up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted, although still puzzled, turned his watch back
three hours.</p>
<p>Biff came to the seat where Ted and Monica both
had their noses pressed to the plane&rsquo;s window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scrunch over, small fry. We&rsquo;ll be raising Diamond
Head soon. Your big brother will point it out
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plane zoomed through the air, racing the sun
to Alohaland. The &ldquo;Fasten Seat Belts&rdquo; sign flashed
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be long now,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;Ought to see Diamond
Head any minute. Look ... just over the
right wing. See that sort of dark blur? That&rsquo;s Oahu,
the island Honolulu is on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minutes later, Diamond Head rose majestically into
view. The plane sped over the yawning crater of the
extinct volcano, then bore to the left out over Honolulu
Harbor. It turned back north, coming in low, and
then settled gently down on Honolulu&rsquo;s International
Airport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<div class="img">

<p class="caption"><i>Diamond Head rose majestically into view</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The plane rolled to a stop, doors opened, and landing
ramps were wheeled into place. The twins, hardly
able to contain their excitement, were first at the
exit. Biff, his mother, and his father were right behind
them.</p>
<p>Outside, a band played the familiar welcoming
song, &ldquo;Aloha.&rdquo; Native girls, in hula skirts, with fragrant
flowers in their hair and brightly colored necklaces
of more flowers around their necks, swayed to
the rhythm of the music.</p>
<p>Monica danced down the landing ramp. At its foot,
a hula dancer stepped forward and placed a lei, a
beautiful necklace woven of flowers&mdash;around the excited
girl&rsquo;s neck. Ted got the same treatment. More
leis for Biff and Mr. and Mrs. Brewster, until the
whole family wore fragrant chains of flowers up to
their chins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Monica. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s everything
I ever dreamed of! Just like I&rsquo;ve read about and seen
in pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a gay, exciting sight. The warm air, the gentle
breeze, the music&mdash;a real Aloha, a real welcome.
The spirit of Hawaii took over at once. Everywhere,
happy people became happier. Gaiety filled the air.
A soft scent of flowers cloaked the new arrivals.</p>
<p>The crowd milled about the gate leading to the
terminal. It seemed there were hundreds of people
all trying to pass through at once. The Brewster family clung together, Monica clutching her mother&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Thomas Brewster looked carefully over the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Dr. Weber,&rdquo; he said to Biff. &ldquo;I thought
surely he&rsquo;d meet us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s just late, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted came up and touched Biff&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Look,
Biff, see that man over there?&rdquo; He pointed.</p>
<p>Biff looked in the direction Ted indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Biff, he&rsquo;s taking pictures. He took several of
you and Dad. I was watching him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s eyes met those of the man with the camera.
He was a swarthy man, short, wearing a rumpled
white suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I guess Dad must be some sort of a celebrity,
taking his picture and all,&rdquo; Ted said excitedly.</p>
<p>Biff didn&rsquo;t think that was the reason. The man
didn&rsquo;t look like a newspaper photographer on an assignment.
His eyes shifted as Biff stared at him. The
man made no attempt to get &ldquo;just one more shot,&rdquo; as
official cameramen are apt to do. Biff started toward
him, determined to find out why the man seemed to
be so interested in photographing Mr. Brewster.</p>
<p>Seeing Biff approach, the man drew back, fading
into the crowd. By the time Biff had forced his way
to where the man had been standing, the picture-taker
had disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Biff frowned. He hadn&rsquo;t liked the man&rsquo;s appearance,
and his slinking away made Biff even more suspicious.
Why had he taken the pictures? How had he
known which of the arriving visitors was Mr. Brewster?
Biff shook his head. The answer to that question
might have some connection with the call his father
had received from Dr. Weber.</p>
<p>He had better tell his father about the incident,
Biff decided. He rejoined the family and was about to
speak when Mr. Brewster raised his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over here! Over here, Mr. Mahenili!&rdquo; He waved
to an approaching man who in turn waved back,
calling, &ldquo;Aloha, my friend. Aloha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Hanale Mahenili, a native Hawaiian with
whom the Brewster family was to stay during their
visit to the islands. Mr. Mahenili was the Hawaiian
representative of the Ajax Mining Company.</p>
<p>Introductions were made, and with the smiling Hawaiian
leading the way, the party entered the airport
terminal.</p>
<p>Passing a newsstand, Mr. Brewster halted quickly.
He strode to the newsstand and snatched up a copy
of the <i>Honolulu Star Bulletin</i>. Biff stepped to his father&rsquo;s
side and read the eight-column headline over
his shoulder.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Dr. Weber, Famous Scientist, Missing</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />Detective Biff</h2>
<p>Thomas Brewster read the startling story hurriedly.
Biff read along with him. The story was sketchy.
There were few details. Dr. Weber had been scheduled
to open the first session of the mining engineers&rsquo;
conference the previous afternoon. The meeting had
started, but Dr. Weber failed to appear. When the
meeting ended, and Dr. Weber was still missing, the
police were notified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about this, Hank?&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster asked Hanale Mahenili. &ldquo;Hanale&rdquo; was the
Hawaiian form of the proper name, &ldquo;Henry.&rdquo;
Among his business associates, Mr. Mahenili liked to
be called Hank. His Hawaiian friends called him Hanale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my friend, I do,&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili replied. &ldquo;It is
most sad, most frightening. In fact, I was the one who
discovered his disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When and how?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s voice showed
his concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon, at the opening of the conference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Brewster turned to his wife. &ldquo;Martha, why
don&rsquo;t you take Ted and Monica over to that bench
and sit down? We&rsquo;ll only be a minute. Biff, you stay
with me. I want you to know what&rsquo;s going on. Sorry,
Hank, but I didn&rsquo;t want my wife alarmed. Please continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff felt highly pleased that his father wanted him
in on whatever was happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, when Johann failed to appear at his
place at the speakers&rsquo; table, I thought at first he might
have been detained, perhaps held up by traffic. Or
that he might have been napping after lunch, and had
overslept. He&rsquo;s an old man, you know. And not too
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know. We&rsquo;ve all been worried about him.
He still tries to do too much for a man his age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I waited about fifteen minutes,&rdquo; Hanale Mahenili
continued. &ldquo;Then I left the head table to go to his
hotel. He&rsquo;s been staying at the Royal Poinciana. On
my way there, my fears that he had become ill increased.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Mr. Mahenili paused, as if ordering his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the hotel, I rang his room. There was no answer.
I went to the desk, and they told me they believed
the doctor was still in his room. He hadn&rsquo;t left
his key at the desk, which was his habit every time he
left the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you were really worried then,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly was, young man. I called for the manager,
and we went up to Johann&rsquo;s room. The manager
had a pass key, and, after knocking, we entered his
suite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no Johann Weber,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Tom. He has a two-room suite. He
wasn&rsquo;t in either room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any evidence that the room had been
searched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mahenili shook his head. &ldquo;It was hard to tell.
Papers on his desk were in a disordered mess. Two
drawers in his bureau were pulled out, with clothing
messed up, and a few things strewn on the door. But
you know how careless Johann was. He was never one
for neatness and order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it could have been someone else who had
searched the desk, and pulled out the drawers,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it could. There was no way of telling definitely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;Were you able to get any idea of
when he had last been in his room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Biff. We weren&rsquo;t. I was coming to that. We
questioned the elevator operators and the desk clerks.
Both night and day clerks. None of them could remember
when they had last seen the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s brows were knitted in questioning thought.
&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;d like to make a suggestion, or, rather, ask
you this. Do you know if Dr. Weber usually had his
breakfast in his room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the idea never occurred to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thinking, son,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were the maids asked if his bed had been
slept in the night before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Mahenili gave a shrug of helplessness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid, young man, that you&rsquo;re a far better detective
than I am. No, the maids weren&rsquo;t questioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Dad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster interrupted his son. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right
with you, Biff. Our first stop in Honolulu had better
be the Royal Poinciana Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My car&rsquo;s right outside. Your luggage should be
off the plane by now,&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili said. &ldquo;The hotel&rsquo;s
on the beach&mdash;Waikiki Beach. I&rsquo;m sure your
family will enjoy seeing the most famous beach in
the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;Ted and Monica
will flip. And so will I. After all, we&rsquo;re tourists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luggage and family were assembled and placed in
Mr. Mahenili&rsquo;s open convertible. The Brewsters
were in for a thrilling ride.</p>
<p>Leaving the airport, Mr. Mahenili turned onto a
dual thoroughfare called Ala Moana. They crossed
the Ala Wai Canal nearing the famous Waikiki Beach
section.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the right,&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili pointed out, &ldquo;is the
Kapaiama Basin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yachts of every color and description lay at anchor
in the beautiful harbor. Some were moving out into
the main harbor of Honolulu.</p>
<p>Everywhere the Brewster family looked, they saw
flowers. One street would be lined with trees bearing
white flowers. The next street would be one of red
flowering trees, or yellow, or deep blue.</p>
<p>The car turned off Ala Moana onto Kalia Road.
They saw the gleaming dome of the Hawaiian Village.
To their right now, they could see the beautiful
hotels standing like sentinels guarding the beach.
Then Mr. Mahenili turned the car into the spacious
Garden-of-Eden-like grounds of the Royal Poinciana
Hotel. Mrs. Brewster and the twins walked down to
the beach. Biff, his father, and their Hawaiian friend
went into the hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The manager of the Royal Poinciana received the
two men and Biff in his office. Biff looked at his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Biff. This was your idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Biff said, addressing the manager, &ldquo;I wonder
if you could find out if Dr. Weber usually had his
breakfast in his room since he&rsquo;s been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily, young man. Won&rsquo;t take a minute.&rdquo; The
manager picked up the telephone on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you ask if he had breakfast there
yesterday morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager nodded his head and spoke into the
phone. He asked both questions Biff had suggested,
nodded his head, and replaced the phone on its cradle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No real help there. Sometimes he called for breakfast
service; sometimes not. Yesterday morning, room
service reports, there was no call from Suite 210-11&mdash;that&rsquo;s
where Dr. Weber was staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one more thing.&rdquo; Biff continued his role of
detective. &ldquo;Would the same maids who were on duty
yesterday be on duty this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check that with the floor supervisor. I think I
know what your question will be&mdash;had Dr. Weber&rsquo;s
bed been slept in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the manager placed his call and asked his
questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;The floor supervisor will call back as soon as she&rsquo;s
checked. Only take a minute or two. While we wait,
let me extend my welcome to Hawaii to you. I regret
that this most unfortunate situation has come
about. But I&rsquo;m sure Dr. Weber will be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Thomas Brewster said. &ldquo;I hope you
are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes. I see. Thank you.&rdquo; The manager replaced
the phone. &ldquo;The supervisor says the maid who
takes care of that suite said Dr. Weber&rsquo;s bed had not
been slept in Monday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked from his father to Mr. Mahenili. Nothing
was said for a moment. Then Mr. Brewster spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more questions, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Can&rsquo;t think of anything else, Dad. Not
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have established the fact that Dr. Weber
must have disappeared sometime on Monday,&rdquo;
Mr. Brewster said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the day he telephoned you, wasn&rsquo;t it,
Dad?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I talked to him late in the afternoon. Here,
that would have been around noon, Hawaii time. I
know he was calling from this hotel. So, we can pinpoint
his disappearance from sometime between noon
Monday, to early Monday night. The doctor always
retired early.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr.
Pierson,&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili said. With Biff and his father,
he arose and left the manager&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>They walked out into the bright sunlight and across
a broad patio, hedged in by flame-colored flowers.
The beach of Waikiki was right in front of them. As
they walked toward it to find Mrs. Brewster and the
twins, the swarthy man with the camera who had
been at the airport earlier, stepped from behind a
palm tree and watched them go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />The Letter</h2>
<p>Hanale Mahenili had driven only a short distance
from the Royal Poinciana when Monica, in the rear
seat of the convertible, let out a howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monica! Whatever in the world!&rdquo; her mother said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lei! My lei! I left it on the beach!&rdquo; Monica
wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew you would,&rdquo; her brother Ted said, in his
I-told-you-so voice.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahenili turned to Tom Brewster and smiled.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easily taken care of. We can get them anywhere
along here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>He pulled the car over to the curb in front of a
charming hotel constructed of red and white coral.
Just to the left of the entrance to the hotel&rsquo;s palm-studded
grounds, sat an old woman surrounded by
flowers of every color and species. The woman was
seated in a high-backed chair, made of coconut
fronds, with her feet in a tub filled with pink, red, and
yellow buds. A flame-red hibiscus was stabbed in her
topknot. She was a plump Hawaiian woman, dressed
in a flowered <i>muumuu</i> the island adaptation of the
mother-hubbard dress introduced many years ago by
New England missionaries.</p>
<p>The old woman&rsquo;s brown, deeply lined face cracked
into a smile as the Brewsters got out of the car.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahenili spoke to her in the musical words of
the native Hawaiian. The old woman&rsquo;s deft hands
grasped a long, slender lei needle, and her hands
seemed to fly as she swiftly threaded at least a hundred
flowers into a beautiful garland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This lei,&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili explained, &ldquo;is being made
of the plumeria. You see,&rdquo; he picked up one of the
flowers, &ldquo;it has five petals. Smell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Brewster took the flower. &ldquo;My, that&rsquo;s lovely!
It seems to me I&rsquo;ve been smelling this lovely scent
ever since we&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have. This blossom is highly perfumed. It
makes our island the sweetest smelling place in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The old woman had finished. She arose and draped
the newly made lei around Monica&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;For the
<i>nani keiki</i>,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means for the &lsquo;beautiful child.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monica blushed, but her smile showed her pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, dipping her head.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahenili handed the woman some money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mahalo, mahalo</i>,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now she&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; to us,&rdquo; Hank
Mahenili explained.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, following a thrilling ride up the
twisting road running over the <i>pali</i>, the cliffs, of the
Koolau Mountain range, they dropped swiftly down
to sea level again on the north side of the island. A
short run along broad, curving beaches, and they arrived
at the Mahenilis&rsquo; beach-front home on Waimanalo
Bay.</p>
<p>The warmth and gracious hospitality of the Mahenili
family made the Brewsters feel at home immediately.
The Mahenilis&rsquo; son, Likake, fifteen, and
Biff were old friends within an hour of their meeting.
Little Wikolia Mahenili was just Monica and Ted&rsquo;s
age, but quite a bit smaller. She considered the twins
her personal property and showed them around with
great pride.</p>
<p>There was only one cloud to mar the Brewsters&rsquo;
sky-high happiness. Dr. Johann Weber was still missing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Late in the second afternoon of the Brewsters&rsquo; stay
in Honolulu, Biff and Likake were swimming when
Biff saw his father come down to the beach and hail
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Li!&rdquo; Biff called, and the boys rode a
breaker back to the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Dad. You want me?&rdquo; Water dripped off Biff&rsquo;s
tanned body. Likake, his round brown face with its
usual eager expression, stood beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to get dressed, now, son. I&rsquo;d like you
to come to the dinner and evening session of our
meeting,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet, Dad. Wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for anything. This
is the night you speak, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Tom Brewster smiled. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t the
main reason for my wanting you there. I&rsquo;ll tell you
about it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Dad. May Likake come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. Mr. and Mrs. Mahenili are coming. The
little ones will stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Likake had gone on ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, Dad? Something to do with
Dr. Weber?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, Biff. But I think there&rsquo;s going to be a
man at the dinner tonight I want you to get a look at.
There could be a connection between him and Dr.
Weber&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that man, Perez Something-or-other&mdash;the
one you mentioned when you got that phone call at
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s brows were knitted in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do,&rdquo;
Biff interrupted. &ldquo;Is it all right if I do a little snooping
after you speak? You&rsquo;ll be at the reception and dance.
I&rsquo;ve got an idea. And Likake said he&rsquo;d help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snooping, son? When trained detectives are on
the job? This is a vacation, and I want you to enjoy
it. But there&rsquo;s no reason why you and Likake can&rsquo;t
nose about a bit. Don&rsquo;t do anything foolish, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The dinner was over. Biff had tried not to stare too
hard nor too long at the husky, shifty-eyed man at the
next table. Perez Soto! Biff sensed the sheer physical
power of the man, and he shuddered involuntarily.
This was no opponent to treat lightly. He couldn&rsquo;t
help thinking: Biff Brewster, take warning!</p>
<p>The chairman rapped for order. Guests at the head
table were introduced, then the chairman turned to
Thomas Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very happy tonight,&rdquo; the chairman said,
&ldquo;to have so distinguished a speaker with us. You all
know him. You all know of the many contributions
he has made in our field. I refer, of course, to the
chief field engineer of the Ajax Mining Company,
Mr. Thomas Brewster.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Mrs. Brewster smiled proudly at her husband.</p>
<p>Tom Brewster arose. His talk was short, direct,
and crisply delivered. He received an ovation when
he concluded.</p>
<p>Biff looked at Likake and winked. The two boys
slipped away from the table unnoticed.</p>
<p>Outside the hotel, Biff asked, &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Poinciana&rsquo;s just a short walk from here. We&rsquo;ll
go in the back way&mdash;through the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s all right? This bellboy is a good
friend of yours?&rdquo; Biff inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I know Hale real well. His brother, Kioni,
and I go to Kamehameha School. That&rsquo;s a school only
for boys and girls of Hawaiian ancestry. We&rsquo;re almost
like blood brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was moonlit. Palm leaves rustled under
a gentle breeze. The steady murmur of the surf was
clear in the night air.</p>
<p>Biff and Likake reached the garden of the Royal
Poinciana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hale told me he would fix it so the deck door of
Dr. Weber&rsquo;s room would be open. Come on,&rdquo; Li said.</p>
<p>The boys walked boldly through the hotel&rsquo;s garden.
Biff knew better than to try to hide their presence.
To do so would attract attention, and that was
just what he didn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>They mounted the stairs to the hotel&rsquo;s second floor,
and walked along the deck until they reached Dr.
Weber&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Hale had done his job. The door was open. Biff
entered the room. Likake, his heart pounding, was
right on his heels.</p>
<p>The room was faintly lighted by the moonlight
from outside. Biff paused in the middle of the room
to allow his eyes to become accustomed to the dim
light.</p>
<p>Then he started his search. Ever since the call to
Indianapolis, Biff had wondered about the letter mentioned
during the conversation. His father had said,
&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; but Biff hadn&rsquo;t been able to. The letter
<i>had</i> to mean something. Where would a man like Dr.
Weber hide a letter? Biff asked himself. He felt certain
that Dr. Weber had been kidnaped, but he didn&rsquo;t
think the abductors had the letter. If they did, then
why were they holding the doctor?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course, I could be all wrong,&rdquo; Biff told himself.
But he didn&rsquo;t think he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likake. Li. Come here,&rdquo; Biff whispered and was
startled to hear Li&rsquo;s voice right back of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here. Right with you.&rdquo; Li sounded scared,
Biff thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. You take the bathroom. It&rsquo;s a letter we&rsquo;re
looking for. I&rsquo;ll take the bedroom, then we&rsquo;ll both
search this room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The boys made a swift, but thorough search.
Nothing in the bathroom. Nothing in the bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where do we look?&rdquo; Li asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take that side of the room. I&rsquo;ll start by the
hall door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s search started at the telephone table. Nothing
in the drawers. But there wouldn&rsquo;t be, Biff told himself.
Too obvious a place. He started to leave the table,
and, glancing down, saw that the table must have
been left in the same condition it had been in on the
day of the call. Crumbs of tobacco were scattered on
the tabletop. Several burned matches were in an ash-tray.
The doctor&rsquo;s tobacco pouch lay at the base of
the lamp. Biff picked it up idly, looking about the
room for the next spot to search.</p>
<p>Standing there, swinging the pouch by its draw-string,
he thought he heard paper crackle. He stood
motionless, halting the swing of the pouch. He
strained his ears. Nothing. He tossed the pouch back
on the table. Again he heard the slight sound of paper
crinkling.</p>
<p>Biff snatched the pouch up again. He opened the
pouch. His hand darted in it and dug deeply in the
tobacco. Paper! His fingers weren&rsquo;t wrong. He withdrew
the paper and held it close to his eyes. It was a
letter, all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff! Biff! Look out!&rdquo; Li shouted.</p>
<p>Biff turned just in time to see a figure leap at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />An Important Find</h2>
<p>Biff sidestepped quickly. His attacker&rsquo;s charge struck
him a glancing blow, spinning him around. He stumbled
backward, almost losing his footing.</p>
<p>In the dim light, Biff saw the man turn and
crouch, ready to charge again. This time, Biff met
charge with charge. The man came at him low. Biff
hurled his body at the attacker even lower. He threw
a bone-crushing football block at the man&rsquo;s knees.
The attacker was upended, his head striking the
floor, his legs flying upward as if he were diving.</p>
<p>Biff leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Biff!&rdquo; Li called from the open doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Biff sprang for the door, hurdling over his attacker
lying on the floor. He felt sure he had cleared him
when a hand snaked up and grabbed Biff by one
ankle. Biff crashed to the floor, stretched out, his
head pointing toward Li, who was standing in the
doorway in dismay.</p>
<p>Rising on one knee, Biff tried to jerk his ankle
free. The man held on with a viselike grip. Biff
thought fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Li! Catch!&rdquo; He tossed Dr. Weber&rsquo;s tobacco
pouch to his friend. It fell at Li&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;Grab it, Li!
Grab it, and scram. I&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li bent over and snatched up the tobacco pouch.
He stood in the doorway, hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; Biff called fiercely. &ldquo;Get out of here
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li, shocked by the sudden violence, was confused.
He felt he should stay and help his friend. But Biff
had ordered him out. Apparently the important thing
was to escape with the tobacco pouch. He turned,
shot through the door, and ran swiftly, silently, along
the porch.</p>
<p>Biff now turned his full attention to freeing himself.
He knew he would have to make his getaway
fast. Someone in the hotel was certain to have heard
the sounds of violence coming from the room. This
was no time for an investigation. Biff knew that he
was as much of a prowler as his attacker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The attacker changed his tactics. Now he wanted
to get free of Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Biff muttered, and threw his
arms around the man&rsquo;s legs. He knew that Li was
now the attacker&rsquo;s prey. Li and the tobacco pouch.</p>
<p>Biff held on. The man, struggling to remain upright,
struck down savagely at the base of Biff&rsquo;s skull.
Biff rolled, avoiding the paralyzing blow.</p>
<p>The attacker, freed of Biff&rsquo;s grasp, leaped for the
door. Biff was on his feet, right behind him. Reaching
the door, Biff saw the man dash for the steps. Instead
of following immediately, Biff decided to wait a moment.
Surely Li had gotten clear. Li knew the
grounds of the hotel well. He&rsquo;d be able to avoid capture,
make a clean getaway with the pouch and its
valuable letter.</p>
<p>When the attacker was out of sight, down the
stairs, Biff stepped out onto the porch. He straightened
his jacket. He wanted to look like a guest of the
hotel if anyone stopped him. From behind he heard
the sounds of someone banging on the corridor door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;for me
to make my departure from this charming hostelry.&rdquo;
He walked unhurriedly toward the stairs. Once there,
though, he dashed down them, taking three steps at a
time. In moments, he was concealed behind a spreading
poinciana shrub.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Biff stood silently. He strained his ears for any
sound, the sound of either Li or his attacker. Only the
soft rustling of palm fronds came to his ears. He decided
to move out. Taking great care to remain in
the cover of trees and shrubs&mdash;the moonlight was
brilliant&mdash;Biff moved cautiously through the garden.
He decided against returning the same way he and Li
had come. He felt sure that his attacker had followed
them from the hotel where his father had spoken.
The man might figure the boys would return to the
hotel. He&rsquo;d be waiting for them there, Biff reasoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure hope Li figures it the way I have,&rdquo; Biff told
himself.</p>
<p>Biff walked in the opposite direction. He came to
the edge of the garden. The street was only a few
feet away. A few feet, but those few feet were open
space, no cover, unprotected from the view of others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have to chance it,&rdquo; Biff said softly. He
planned to dash across the opening, run down the
street, and hope to find a cruising taxicab.</p>
<p>Biff tensed. He thought he heard a noise behind
him. It sounded like a small twig snapping. He turned
his head slowly. He didn&rsquo;t want a second attack from
behind that night. Now he felt positive that someone
was moving in the shrubbery nearby.</p>
<p>Then he heard it, softly, barely audible above the
noise of the rustling leaves and nearby surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Biff let out his held breath in a deep sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here, Li,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>His Hawaiian friend emerged from behind a tree
and joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all right, Biff? You hurt?&rdquo; Li asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? No. Not even shaken up. But how about
you? And the tobacco pouch. You&rsquo;ve still got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li nodded his head, extending a hand with the
pouch in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell, Li. Great. How did you get away? Did
that guy try to follow you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tried to follow all right. But I fooled him. I
kept just far enough ahead of him so he could hear
me. I made little noises.&rdquo; Biff could see Li&rsquo;s grin in
the moonlight. &ldquo;So I could lead him away. I wanted
to be sure you got away okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty smart, Li. But how did you finally shake
him off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I led him way to the rear of the garden. Then I
quit making any noise. I moved like a cat, circled
around, and headed for here. I sort of figured you
wouldn&rsquo;t try to get back to the other hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good figuring. You and I are going to make a
great team. But I think we&rsquo;d better get out of here
fast before &lsquo;Nosy&rsquo; figures the same way we did. Where
would be the best place to get a cab?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just follow me.&rdquo; Li turned, and instead of heading
for the street, he plunged back into the garden. He
led Biff along the edge of the garden, until they came
to a low hedge fence, the rear boundary of the Poinciana&rsquo;s
grounds. Li leaped over it, Biff following.
Then the Hawaiian boy cut to his right, and in a few
moments, they jumped another hedge into another
formal garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; Biff asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the garden of the Aloha Hale&mdash;that means
Aloha House. It&rsquo;s a small hotel. We can find a taxi
right out front. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved noiselessly through the garden, and
emerged on the lighted street just to the left of the
hotel&rsquo;s entrance. They were lucky. A taxicab was
waiting at its stand. The boys quickly hopped in.</p>
<p>Biff sat back. Relief came to him, and he suddenly
realized how much his recent exertions had taken out
of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wowie! Am I ever glad to get out of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too, Biff. Where do we go? Back to the hotel,
or home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your house. I told Dad we&rsquo;d take a cab back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li gave the driver instructions.</p>
<p>Biff looked at the luminous dial of his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers! Do you know it&rsquo;s been two hours since
we left the hotel! Seems like only minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Brewster and Hank Mahenili were still up
when the boys reached home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we were beginning to wonder what had happened
to you two,&rdquo; Tom Brewster said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty, Dad,&rdquo; Biff said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it.&rdquo; His father was looking at Biff&rsquo;s
rumpled white jacket. One shoulder of it bore a
smudge where he had landed on the green carpet of
Dr. Weber&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a little adventure,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;More than
we expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Li?&rdquo; Hank Mahenili asked, a
worried look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Dad. It was Biff who had the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight?&rdquo; Tom Brewster stood up. &ldquo;Just what happened,
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff gave his father and Hank Mahenili a fast fill-in
on the night&rsquo;s adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we got what we were looking for,&rdquo; he concluded.
Biff reached in his jacket pocket and pulled
out Dr. Weber&rsquo;s tobacco pouch. He took out the
crumpled letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has a New Zealand postmark on it. I think
it&rsquo;s that letter you talked to Dr. Weber about when
he called you back in Indianapolis. I haven&rsquo;t read it,
though. Thought you might not want me to know
what&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Thomas Brewster took the letter. He read it rapidly,
then reread it. His frown showed how deep his
concentration was. Without a word, he handed the
letter to Mahenili. The Hawaiian read it.</p>
<p>The two boys watched their parents. Finally Biff
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it important, Dad? I thought it might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very important, Biff. Wouldn&rsquo;t you say so,
Hank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbelievably so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked questioningly at his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This <i>is</i> the letter Dr. Weber mentioned; the letter
he received from Jim Huntington. It tells of a find
Jim made in New Zealand&mdash;a fabulous mining discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why he was coming here to meet you
and Dr. Weber?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then whoever it was attacked me tonight, or kidnaped
Dr. Weber, would know where the find was,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, Biff. They&rsquo;d know of it, but not
where it was. Huntington was bringing samples of
the ore, and details of its location, with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That information, then, must still be in his sunken
sloop,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>Tom Brewster nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find it, won&rsquo;t we, Dad?&rdquo; the boy
asked eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re surely going to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for several minutes. Everyone&rsquo;s
mind was filled with thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad.&rdquo; It was Biff who broke the silence. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you think we can read good news in my finding this
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t you think from this that Dr. Weber
must still be alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, Biff?&rdquo; Hank Mahenili asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, whoever grabbed him, since they didn&rsquo;t
find the letter, must figure Dr. Weber knows what
Mr. Huntington discovered, and they&rsquo;re holding him
until he tells them about it, or tells them where the
letter is. They couldn&rsquo;t know that the location isn&rsquo;t
described in the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how would they know anything about it if
they hadn&rsquo;t seen the letter?&rdquo; Li piped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have their ways,&rdquo; Tom Brewster replied.
&ldquo;The doctor probably told someone else about Huntington&rsquo;s
coming here. Not that he would have said
why. But Huntington&rsquo;s explorations are well known.
Whoever kidnapped Dr. Weber would know that a
meeting between Dr. Weber, Huntington, and me
could lead to something of tremendous value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that, Dad? Can you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could, Biff, but I don&rsquo;t think I will&mdash;not yet. The
fewer people who know what Huntington discovered,
the better. And it would be safer for you, too,
not to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, Dad....&rdquo; Biff paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Biff, you&rsquo;re in this now right up to your
young neck. It could easily be figured that you now
know as much as Dr. Weber, since you found the letter.
That makes you a target, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff found it difficult to swallow the lump which
had suddenly come into his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />The Police Call</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get a good look at your attacker, Biff?&rdquo;
Tom Brewster asked his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, Dad. He came at me too fast. And it was
fairly dark in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering. Perez Soto&mdash;you know, the
man I pointed out to you at the dinner&mdash;well, he
wasn&rsquo;t at the reception afterward. I thought he
might have followed you boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Dad. Perez Soto is a good-sized
man. Husky. This fellow I had the hassle with was
smaller, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that Mr. Perez Soto,&rdquo; Li added, &ldquo;he was
wearing a white dinner jacket. This man wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;He could have changed, son,&rdquo; Hank Mahenili
pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li&rsquo;s right, though,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;I think we both will
agree that it wasn&rsquo;t Perez Soto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, boys. Better get to bed. It&rsquo;s late, and
tomorrow&rsquo;s going to be a big day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">It was a big day, and it ended with a bang.</p>
<p>The engineering conference had wound up the
night before with the dinner at which Biff&rsquo;s father
spoke. This day, the day following, Hanale Mahenili
had invited a selected group from among those who
had attended the conference to a <i>luau</i> at his house.
The prospect of going to the <i>luau</i>, the traditional
Hawaiian feast, especially one cooked by a native of
the island, was exciting.</p>
<p>Hank Mahenili had been up early to get things under
way. He was going to supervise the cooking of
the <i>luau</i> personally. It took all day to prepare a <i>luau</i>
properly, and when Hank Mahenili did something,
he did it right.</p>
<p>Biff and Li helped with the early preparations.
They dug a deep pit in which a pig would be roasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else we can do, sir?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, Biff,&rdquo; his Hawaiian friend replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how about a swim, Li?&rdquo; Biff inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to try real surfing this morning?&rdquo; Li asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do I! Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Biff had arrived, the boys had swum before
breakfast, after breakfast, and practically all their free
time. Li was an expert swimmer, especially under water.
At first, Biff became worried when his new friend
dived and seemed to remain under water long past
the safety point. But always, Li&rsquo;s laughing face would
break the water just when Biff was about to dive for
him.</p>
<p>Biff and Li hit the water and swam out into the
ocean with powerful strokes. Biff was just a bit faster
than Li. They took the plunge first to loosen up their
muscles and became accustomed to the water. Next
they tackled the surfboards.</p>
<p>Li swam most of the way back under water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still worry me, Li. I don&rsquo;t know how you
can hold your breath that long,&rdquo; Biff remarked as
the boys walked up the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just practice, Biff. I&rsquo;ve been doing it since I could
walk, I guess. Dad tells me I could swim before I
could walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys paused to watch an outrigger come
plunging toward the shore atop a long, rolling wave.</p>
<p>The outrigger was being paddled furiously by two
Hawaiian boys. On one side of the canoe, its outrigging
extended out in two arching arms, connected by
a buoyant float of <i>wiliwili</i> wood to give the slender
canoe more stability.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>The canoe ground ashore, and its laughing passengers
scrambled out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set, Biff? Ready to make a real try at it today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By me that&rsquo;s fine. I think I almost got the knack of
it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes to you, it comes all of a sudden.
You just sort of feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I feel it today,&rdquo; Biff said, laughing.</p>
<p>The first day, the boys had swum out to where the
long rollers formed, and had ridden them in, their
bodies held stiff. Li wanted Biff to become accustomed
to the waves. Then they had started with the
surfboards.</p>
<p>The two boys walked across the beach to two
long, brightly painted surfboards made of <i>wiliwili</i>
wood. They carried the boards out into the ocean
until they were waist deep. Then, sprawling on the
boards, they paddled off shore several hundred yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ll try it here. Head your board toward
shore,&rdquo; Li called.</p>
<p>Biff slowly turned his board until its pointed bow
was aimed at the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the first few waves pass until you get the feel
and lift. Then, when one comes that feels good&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the only way I can explain it&mdash;start paddling
like crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Biff followed instructions. He felt himself being
lifted by the first wave, then a second. Now came a
huge roller, raising both boys high above the trough
left by the preceding roller. Biff started paddling
furiously, still lying face down on the board. He felt
the wave grab it. The board picked up speed, riding
right at the crest of the roller. He had made it!</p>
<p>Li was right alongside. The boys were speeding
shoreward at nearly thirty miles per hour.</p>
<p>When the roller broke on the shallow shore, Biff
was tossed off in the foaming breaker. He grabbed
his board and held on until the wave smoothed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! That&rsquo;s the most thrilling ride I&rsquo;ve ever had!&rdquo;
he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did great, Biff,&rdquo; Li said. &ldquo;But just wait. If you
think that was a charge, wait till you ride the board
standing up. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Biff agreed promptly.</p>
<p>Out they went again. Again they waited for the
right feel of the roller. Biff felt one take his board. He
was speeding shoreward. He looked over the water
at his friend. He saw Li rise to a knee crouch, then
slowly straighten up until he was standing straight,
head held high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Biff tried it. He got to his knees. Carefully feeling
for his balance, he started straightening up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
done it,&rdquo; he said triumphantly to himself. He looked
shoreward just in time to catch a blinding splash of
salt spray. He blinked his eyes, and the next thing he
knew, he was floundering in the water.</p>
<p>Li, seeing what had happened, leaped off his board,
turned it, and came paddling back to Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to tell you. When you get up, hold your
head high, and back. Then the salt spray doesn&rsquo;t hit
you in the eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i> you tell me,&rdquo; Biff said, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to make it this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started out even. Li got up first. Biff took
seconds longer. He was more careful this time. The
tough part was straightening up from a crouching
position to an erect one, then placing one foot ahead
of the other, and getting a good balance. Biff arose
slowly, slowly but surely. He made it. The two boys
rode standing up, only a few feet separating their
two boards.</p>
<p>Li turned to Biff and grinned. Then he clasped his
hands over his head, making a handshake of congratulation.
He was so thrilled at seeing Biff make it that
he forgot about himself. This time it was the expert
who spilled himself into the water.</p>
<p>Biff rode triumphantly into shore alone.</p>
<p class="tb">The <i>luau</i> was ready. The guests had arrived. Li
burst into Biff&rsquo;s room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<div class="img">

<p class="caption"><i>Biff got to his knees, carefully feeling for his balance</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wikiwiki</i>, Biff! Hurry. Everything&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wikiwiki-ing just as fast as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, put on this <i>aloha</i> shirt&mdash;all the <i>kanes</i> wear
them. The <i>wahines</i>, the women, wear <i>holukus</i> or
<i>muumuus</i>. You call them mother-hubbards, only ours
are brightly colored with big flowers printed on
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the kids&mdash;what do you call them&mdash;<i>keikis</i>?
What do they wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li laughed at Biff&rsquo;s pronunciation. &ldquo;How many
times do I have to tell you that <i>every</i> letter in a Hawaiian
word is pronounced? Here&rsquo;s how you say
&lsquo;children&rsquo; in Hawaiian: <i>kay-ee-keys</i>, with the accent
on the first syllable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, <i>Li-ka-kay</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;ve said my name
right. You stick around long enough, and you&rsquo;ll be a
real Hawaiian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name in English, Li?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Dick&mdash;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>luau</i> was being held in the garden in the rear
of the Mahenilis&rsquo; home. Under gaily striped awnings,
long tables had been set up. They were decorated
with fragrant-smelling ferns, flowers, pineapples and
bananas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>At each place setting, there had been placed a <i>niu</i>,
a coconut with its top slashed off, still containing the
<i>wai niu</i>, or coconut water, which would be sipped
with the meal.</p>
<p>Hank Mahenili stood over the <i>lua</i>&mdash;the hole Biff
and Li had dug earlier in the day&mdash;making sure that
the <i>puaa</i> was done to a turn. A <i>luau</i> isn&rsquo;t the real
thing without a roast pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready, everyone,&rdquo; Hank called out, and started
cutting pieces of the pig. The meat was so tender it
fell apart. Hank placed the meat on <i>ti</i> leaves, and
servants carried it to the tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a meal!&rdquo; Biff said, finding his place beside
Li. &ldquo;Never saw so much food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the <i>puaa</i>, there was a <i>umeke</i>, a small
bowl, of <i>poi</i>&mdash;taro root pounded to a paste. There
was a dish, called <i>pa</i>, of <i>lomilomi</i>&mdash;salmon, which
didn&rsquo;t look a bit like salmon, since it had been shredded
and kneaded into a salad. There was also a dish of <i>moa</i>,
chicken cooked in coconut juice, and another <i>pa</i> of
<i>opihi</i>, a small, delicately flavored shell fish.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t all. There were <i>pas</i> of <i>i&rsquo;a</i>, fish, and
sweet potatoes, called <i>uwala kalua</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I eat all this, I&rsquo;ll explode,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, have some of this,&rdquo; Li said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; There was a suspicious look on Biff&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious. Called <i>limu</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff took a small bite. His face lit up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good.
But what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seaweed,&rdquo; Li said and burst out into laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly. <i>This</i> is seaweed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Not the kind you know, though.
This is an edible seaweed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s edible. Give me more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everywhere one looked, Mahenili&rsquo;s guests were devouring
the food. Strange though some of it looked,
no one could deny the food&rsquo;s succulence. People were
falling to as if they hadn&rsquo;t eaten for days.</p>
<p>Biff took one final bite and sat back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t eat another thing if I had to. Don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ll ever want to eat again.&rdquo; He looked at his
friend and smiled. &ldquo;<i>Mahalo, aikane</i>. Thanks, friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s attention was attracted by a Hawaiian, not in
<i>luau</i> dress, but in business clothes, coming across the
garden. He saw the man approach Mr. Mahenili.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Biff asked, nudging Li.</p>
<p>Li looked, and his face became serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly. That&rsquo;s Mr. Kapatka. I wonder what he&rsquo;s
doing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just who, <i>aikane</i>, is Mr. Kapatka?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the chief of the Honolulu police.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />Mysterious Message</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt your festivities,&rdquo; Chief of Police
Kapatka said to Mr. Mahenili.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Kioni,&rdquo; Li&rsquo;s father replied courteously.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the end of our <i>luau</i>, and I know
you&rsquo;ve got your job to do. Just what is it? You have
word of the missing Dr. Weber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the answer to that has to be both yes and no.
Actually, I&rsquo;m here to see one of your guests. You
have a Mr. Thomas Brewster staying with you, do
you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his son?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Brewster and his family are staying with
me on their visit to the islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to speak to them,&rdquo; the chief requested.</p>
<p>Hank Mahenili excused himself and crossed the garden
to where Mr. and Mrs. Brewster stood chatting
with other guests.</p>
<p>Biff and Li had watched the police chief talking to
Li&rsquo;s father. Now they saw Mr. Mahenili and Mr.
Brewster coming toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Biff,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;Police want to
talk to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li tagged along, the deep brown eyes in his bronze
face wide with curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Thomas Brewster, Chief. And this is my son,
Biff. Has Dr. Weber been found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Brewster, unfortunately not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is Dr. Weber you want to see us about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, yes. Let me explain. An hour ago, we
had a call from Wailuku, that&rsquo;s the capital of the Island
of Maui. An emergency case had been brought to
the hospital there&mdash;a man suffering from a deep stab
wound. The man was identified as a certain Juan
Tokawto. He has a police record. A minor criminal,
in and out of several scrapes, but a bad character. A
man for hire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But what has that to do with me, or my
son?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that, sir. Tokawto was found unconscious.
At the time the police called from Wailuku,
he was still unconscious, so they hadn&rsquo;t been able to
question him. They did find in his wallet, though, a
picture, a small photograph&mdash;two photographs, in
fact. They identified the man in one of the photos
from a picture that appeared on the front page of our
Honolulu paper yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Kioni Kapatka paused. He apparently enjoyed
building up suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The photograph in our paper was one of you, Mr.
Brewster. It appeared the day you spoke at the mining
engineers&rsquo; meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The small photo found in Tokawto&rsquo;s pocket was
also of you, Mr. Brewster. Of you and a lad whom I
presume to be your son. This boy, here.&rdquo; He looked
at Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Dad? I told you about that man at the
airport snapping pictures of you, of you and me. Ted
spotted him first,&rdquo; Biff reminded his father.</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster nodded his head. &ldquo;Well, Chief
Kapatka, I can&rsquo;t imagine why any criminal would be
carrying a picture of me and my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember, Mr. Brewster, I said that man was
carrying two pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other picture was that of the missing Dr.
Weber.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The police chief&rsquo;s last statement struck the group
like a bombshell. For moments, nothing was said. The
chief broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that now you will see the connection,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Thomas Brewster replied. &ldquo;There must be
one. But just what? Have you any ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this, Mr. Brewster. The man Tokawto must
have been hired to keep a close check on your and
your son&rsquo;s movements. I suspect he was in Honolulu
yesterday. He must have learned something&mdash;something
of value to someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Dad, I wonder if that man could have been
the one who&mdash;who&mdash;&rdquo; Biff paused. He didn&rsquo;t want to
reveal to the police chief that he had gone into Dr.
Weber&rsquo;s rooms at the Royal Poinciana without authority.
&ldquo;You know, Dad. The man I had that little
scrape with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could have been, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police chief looked at Biff with renewed interest.
However, he didn&rsquo;t press Biff for a fuller explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my belief, Mr. Brewster,&rdquo; Chief Kapatka continued,
&ldquo;that when Tokawto went back to Maui, he
thought his information was worth more than he was
being paid. His attempts at getting more money were
rewarded by a stab in the abdomen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some reward!&rdquo; Biff interjected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why the Island of Maui?&rdquo; his father asked.</p>
<p>The police chief shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Biff touched his father&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I have an idea on that,
Dad,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you think that perhaps Dr. Weber might
be on the island, or on a nearby one? And that
whoever kidnaped him must have his headquarters
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men considered Biff&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could be right, Biff. Do you agree, Chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Kapatka nodded his head in agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police on Maui have asked that you come to
Wailuku. They want you there when Tokawto has
recovered sufficiently for questioning,&rdquo; the chief said.
&ldquo;<i>If</i> he recovers,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go right away. Can you come along, Hank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Let me explain to my guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff felt a tug on his sleeve. It was Li.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about asking if I can go, too, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You can help us.&rdquo; Biff turned to his father.
&ldquo;Dad, Li ought to go along, too. He speaks Hawaiian,
and he and I might pick up some valuable information.
Would you ask Mr. Mahenili?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster nodded his head. &ldquo;You better go
pack a small bag. We may be there for a day or two.
Hop to it. We want to get over there quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Li went into the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get there soon, Biff. We&rsquo;ll take the Inter-Island
Street-Car System.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Street-car! What are you talking about? Street-cars
running across the ocean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we call the Hawaiian
Airlines. They make so many flights each day, it&rsquo;s
just like standing on a corner waiting for the next
street-car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was. When the boys and their fathers
reached the airport, they learned there was a plane
taking off within fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>The flight to Kahului, the principal airport on Maui,
took only thirty minutes. They arrived just as dusk
was spreading over the Valley Island, as Maui is
called.</p>
<p>The drive from the airport to the capital of Maui,
Wailuku, was a short one. The police were expecting
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just been talking to the police in Hana,&rdquo;
the Wailuku police chief said. &ldquo;Tokawto is still on
the danger list. They haven&rsquo;t been able to get anything
out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this Tokawto isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo; Tom Brewster
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s in Hana, a coastal town about sixty
miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we start right down there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can, of course, Mr. Brewster. However,
Tokawto&rsquo;s been placed under heavy sedation. There&rsquo;s
little chance that he&rsquo;ll do any talking tonight. I&rsquo;d suggest
you spend the night here, then drive down early
tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Tom,&rdquo; Hank Mahenili said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
want to miss the drive to Hana. It&rsquo;s a truly beautiful
and thrilling experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sixty-mile drive was one of continuous curves.
The road snaked around cliffs, dived down to sea
level, then climbed back up another cliff.</p>
<p>The party checked into the Han-Maui Hotel, then
left for the police station.</p>
<p>Tokawto had come out of his sedation, but was
still in such serious condition that his words seemed a
meaningless jumble during his conscious spells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s going to make it or not,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Biff stepped to the wounded man&rsquo;s bedside for a
closer look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>is</i> the man who was snapping pictures of us
at the airport, Dad,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you also think he&rsquo;s the one you had your
tussle with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could be,&rdquo; Biff said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s about
the right size. I didn&rsquo;t get a close look at his face,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Tokawto moaned. He opened his eyes. He looked
at Biff, and a frown of recognition crossed his face.
He stretched out one hand and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka Lae,&rdquo; he said, and repeated the two Hawaiian
words: &ldquo;Ka Lae.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean, Hank?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka Lae is the name of the southern tip of the Big
Island-Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he was trying to tell me that,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure he recognized me, and is trying to tell us that we
ought to go to Ka Lae.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s father nodded his head. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,
Biff. Those words have a meaning for me, too. I&rsquo;ll tell
you about it later. Back at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked the short distance back to their quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank, do you think we could charter a boat here
for a couple of days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can. You&rsquo;re going to Hawaii?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. To Ka Lae. But, I want it thought that we&rsquo;re
just off on a fishing cruise. No need for anyone but us
to know our real reason for going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Dr. Weber might be being held on
the Big Island?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it quite likely, Biff. But there&rsquo;s still another
reason for us to take a good look around Ka
Lae. That I&rsquo;ll tell you about when we&rsquo;re on our boat
at sea. Would you mind hopping up to my room and
getting my sun glasses, Biff? Then we&rsquo;ll go see about
a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Biff took the stairs to the second floor three at a
stride. Li was right behind him. Biff scrambled
through his father&rsquo;s bag, looking for the glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Biff. Look at this!&rdquo; Biff, glasses in hand,
turned to see Li pointing to the mirror of the room&rsquo;s
dresser. He walked over for a closer look.</p>
<p>On the mirror, written in soap, was a message:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;JW for Cs&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />Starting a Search</h2>
<p>Biff wasted no time in getting back down to the
lobby of the hotel. He told his father about the message
written in soap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the letters, you say&mdash;<i>JW</i> for <i>CS</i>?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster
exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to my room. I want to
see them for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Brewsters and the Mahenilis went up the stairs.
As they neared Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s room, they noticed its
door was open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what can that mean? More trouble? That
door was closed.&rdquo; The question flashed through Biff&rsquo;s
mind, but he did not speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The door, it developed, had been left ajar by the
maid, but it was what she was doing that upset
Thomas Brewster.</p>
<p>They entered the room just in time to see the maid
wipe the soap message off the mirror.</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster started to speak, but he realized
that she was only doing her job. When the maid left
the room, Mr. Brewster questioned his son closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this is important, Biff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can you
remember exactly how those letters were written?
I mean, were they all capitals? Or was one or more of
them in lower case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower case?&rdquo; Li looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means small letters, Li. Now let&rsquo;s see, Dad.
I&rsquo;m almost positive that the <i>J</i> and the <i>W</i> were capitals.
How about you, Li? Is that how you remember it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hawaiian lad nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think I&rsquo;m sure about the C. It was a capital
letter, too. Right, Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I think so, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the <i>s</i>, Biff? This is important,&rdquo; his
father said.</p>
<p>Biff frowned. He closed his eyes trying to recreate
a mental picture of the soap scrawl. &ldquo;Dad, I can&rsquo;t be
absolutely sure, but I think the <i>s</i> was a small letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked at Li. Li could only shrug his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your memory is probably right, Biff. You
have a pretty good one, and besides, it fits,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m completely mystified,&rdquo; Hank Mahenili put in.
&ldquo;All this talk about letters, capitals, and small letters.
What do they mean, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first, I think&mdash;I hope&mdash;they mean that Dr.
Weber is definitely alive. That&rsquo;s good news. They
must also mean that he&rsquo;s being held prisoner. Not so
good. The doctor is old, you know, and just how
much he can stand at his age is doubtful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s alive, we&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; Biff cut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the letters, what do they mean?&rdquo; Hank repeated
his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>J</i> and the <i>W</i>, I&rsquo;m sure, stand for Johann
Weber. The <i>C</i>&mdash;capital <i>C</i>&mdash;and the small <i>s</i>, is the
chemical symbol for cesium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cesium!&rdquo; Understanding came to Hank Mahenili.
Any informed engineer knew the importance of this
element.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what is cesium, Dad? And what is it used
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technically, son, its atomic number is 55, and its
atomic weight is 132.91. Its use?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster smiled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you this, we&rsquo;ll never get to the moon without
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s used in rocket propulsion?&rdquo; Biff
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff. It&rsquo;s a high-thrust, long-life
rocket propulsion fuel. Most costly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;More than gold?&rdquo; Li asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much more, Li. If you and Biff had about ten
pounds of it between you, you&rsquo;d have your education
paid at any college you wanted to go to&mdash;M.I.T.,
Cal Tech&mdash;any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Must be worth more than a thousand dollars
a pound, then,&rdquo; Biff said, his voice filled with
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Biff. The refining process is what makes it so
expensive. Scientists and explorers&mdash;like Jim Huntington&mdash;have
carried on extensive searches to locate a
field where the purity of the ore is high&mdash;higher than
in those fields we now know about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Huntington&mdash;he thought he had made
such a strike?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>Before answering, Tom Brewster went to the door.
He opened it cautiously and looked up and down
the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any eavesdroppers or spies lurking
around.&rdquo; He had lowered his voice until it was little
more than a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll fill you in so you will all know what
we&rsquo;re up against.&rdquo; Hank Mahenili, Li, and Biff
crowded close to Mr. Brewster. They didn&rsquo;t want to
miss a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;That letter you found the other night, boys, is
important. Not as important as Dr. Weber&rsquo;s abductors
think it is, but it does tell of a cesium find Huntington
made in New Zealand. He felt it to be a sensational
discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;High-grade ore?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. In his letter to Dr. Weber, Huntington told
of the find, of his belief in its high degree of purity.
He was bringing a sample, and a map of the location,
to Honolulu. Dr. Weber was to assay it. Then, if it
proved out as expected, Ajax Mining was to move in
on the deal and exploit the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Huntington never got here,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That call I received from Dr. Weber&mdash;you
remember, Biff. The doctor had just arrived in
Honolulu when word of Huntington&rsquo;s loss at sea became
known. There was an extensive sea and air
search, but nothing was found, no sign of the sloop&rsquo;s
wreckage, and, even more unfortunately, no slightest
sign of Huntington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could that be, Mr. Brewster?&rdquo; Li wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is thought that Jim Huntington&rsquo;s sloop must
have split its seams open in a heavy squall, Li. Huntington
apparently stuck by his boat and went down
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it supposed to have gone down somewhere
off Ka Lae, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But there&rsquo;s a lot of ocean off the
southern tip of the Island of Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Biff was frowning with concentration. &ldquo;Ka Lae,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Those are the two words Tokawto mumbled
to us this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think Dr. Weber is being held somewhere near
there, while somebody tries to locate the sunken
sloop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it now, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think his abductors might be, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster looked at Hank Mahenili. &ldquo;Any
doubt in your mind, Hank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one bit,&rdquo; the Hawaiian answered, shaking his
head. &ldquo;Perez Soto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make contact with us again,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father
said. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know exactly what is in this letter
Biff found. His message&mdash;the one written on that mirror,
is telling me that if we want to see Dr. Weber
alive again, then I&rsquo;ll have to tell him where the cesium
strike is located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that information is at the bottom of the sea,&rdquo;
Biff said soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do everything
we can to try and spot that sunken sloop. Dr.
Weber&rsquo;s life depends on it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />Wharf Rats</h2>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s father had concluded his conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you all know as much as I do. Now we
move into action. Biff, you and Li will be our ground
forces. Li&rsquo;s father and I will take over the naval side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;re not going to the Big Island with
you?&rdquo; Biff was dismayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Biff. I want you and Li to roam about Hana.
You both had a good look at Perez Soto. I&rsquo;m sure
you could describe him. Make a few inquiries. See if
anyone of his description has been in Hana recently.
Hana is a very big place. I&rsquo;m sure he was here yesterday&mdash;probably
met with Tokawto, to Tokawto&rsquo;s
misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll check on him, too. We&rsquo;ll stop by the police
station,&rdquo; Biff replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster went on, &ldquo;our job is to rent
a boat. A yawl, about thirty feet. Biff and I can sail,
and I&rsquo;m sure you and Li have handled boats all your
lives. I don&rsquo;t want a captain or a crew. Just a boat.
Think we can rent one here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive we can, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then. Boys, you start your investigation.
You&rsquo;re pretty good at it. But be careful. Meet us back
here in time for lunch. I hope we can sail tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Li went to their room and changed into
shorts. Then they went out to explore Hana.</p>
<p>The mid-morning sun was bright. The sky was
clear. It was a beautiful day on the Island of Maui. The
boys covered the small business section, stopping in a
few stores, and asking if anyone had seen a man answering
to the description of Perez Soto. They were
becoming discouraged as noon approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the police station, Li. See how
Tokawto&rsquo;s condition is,&rdquo; Biff suggested.</p>
<p>They learned that the wounded man was still much
the same. It would be a close thing if he lived.</p>
<p>Leaving the police station, Biff had an idea. &ldquo;Look,
Li,&rdquo; he said, frowning. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going about this thing
all wrong. If Perez Soto kidnaped Dr. Weber and
took him to Hawaii, he&rsquo;d have to have a boat,
wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Biff, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s head for the docks and find out if anyone
looking like Perez Soto has rented a boat in the
last week or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They headed for the waterfront. Suddenly Biff
turned to his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look back, Li,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but I think
we&rsquo;re being followed. Just walk along as we&rsquo;re doing
now. When we get to the middle of the next block,
you leave me. We&rsquo;ll shake hands, then you cross the
street. Go into one of the stores. Find a place where
you can see out but can&rsquo;t be seen from the street. Keep
a sharp lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li&rsquo;s face showed his excitement. &ldquo;I get you, Biff.
You want me to see if someone keeps on following
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m going to continue on down the
street another few blocks. Then I&rsquo;ll cut back and meet
you in front of one of those stores. Look sharp, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys solemnly shook hands. Biff clapped Li on
the shoulder. &ldquo;Be seeing you,&rdquo; he called loudly when
Li had reached the middle of the street. Then Biff
continued his &ldquo;sight-seeing&rdquo; walk along Hana&rsquo;s main
street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>He desperately wanted to look behind him, but he
knew that to do so would spoil his plan. He walked
three blocks, stopping every so often to stare into a
window. If he was being followed, he wanted to give
Li plenty of time to spot his pursuer.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the street, where the business
section left off and the residential section began, Biff
cut across the street, then started slowly back to his
rendezvous with Li on the opposite side.</p>
<p>He saw Li in front of a small store, standing under
a brightly colored awning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you see anything?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Biff. But I don&rsquo;t know for sure. There
was a man, maybe one hundred feet behind you.
Every time you stopped, he&rsquo;d stop, too, and sort of
step into a doorway, in case you looked back, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I was being followed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, Biff. I thought so at first. But then this man
turned into a side street before you reached the end of
your walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you tell that, from inside that store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh? Well, I stepped out on the sidewalk, so I
could see better. Once you got down to the next
block, I couldn&rsquo;t see you through the window any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff smiled. &ldquo;I was being followed, all right, Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you be sure? This man didn&rsquo;t keep
on following you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know why, Li? Because when you stepped
out on the sidewalk, the man spotted you. He had
seen you with me, and knew you had planted yourself
in the store just to check and see if he was following
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m some detective! Charlie
Chan would box my ears, as he was always doing with
No. 1. Son. I&rsquo;m sorry, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it get you down. Let&rsquo;s go find out about
boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Li had flunked his first detective test, he more
than redeemed himself on his second.</p>
<p>At the waterfront, the boys spotted several signs
announcing boats for hire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see if I can find a <i>kamaaina</i>,&rdquo; Li suggested.
&ldquo;I could talk to him. He might even know my family,
then I could find out a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Li. Good idea. I&rsquo;ll take a walk out on
that dock and wait for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff stood on the end of the pier, scaling small sea
shells into the water. He could see Li going from
place to place. At a nearby dock, Li took much
longer than at the other places where he had inquired.
Biff could see him talking to an old Hawaiian, bent of
body, wearing a floppy sun hat. He saw Li look in his
direction and signal for him to come over.</p>
<p>Proud excitement shone from Li&rsquo;s face as Biff came
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got big news, Biff,&rdquo; Li exclaimed. &ldquo;This
<i>kamaaina</i> has told me just what we want to know.
He&rsquo;s an old man, speaks no English, but he says he
knew my father&rsquo;s family many years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what about Perez Soto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. The oldtimer says he didn&rsquo;t
rent any boat last week, but at that dock up there&mdash;&rdquo; Li
pointed to a dock about one hundred feet down
the shore&mdash;&ldquo;a <i>malihini</i>&mdash;that means a newcomer&mdash;rented
a big power boat about five days ago. He
can&rsquo;t remember the exact day. He&rsquo;s old, I guess, and
kind of forgetful. But he thinks it was on a Monday.
That would be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last Monday! That was the day Dr. Weber had
disappeared!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good going, Li,&rdquo; Biff exclaimed. &ldquo;And you described
Perez Soto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure did. And the <i>kamaaina</i> says he thinks it was
the same man. The man came to him, first, but he
didn&rsquo;t have any boat big enough to suit this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Li, I think we&rsquo;re getting somewhere. I want
to try one more thing before we go back. I want to
make sure I was being followed. I think it&rsquo;s important
to know if any of Perez Soto&rsquo;s men are still in Hana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would they be,&rdquo; Li demanded, &ldquo;if Perez Soto
and the doctor are on the Big Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget about Tokawto. I&rsquo;m sure Perez Soto
would want to know if Tokawto recovers enough to
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a trick up my sleeve. If someone is following
me, it might be because he thinks I might still
have that letter.&rdquo; Biff took out his address book and
tore paper from the back of it. &ldquo;You know he might
be just stupid enough to think I was still carrying the
letter with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;d have to be plenty <i>lolo</i> for that, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty <i>lolo</i>? What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means dumb or stupid,&rdquo; Li replied.</p>
<p>Biff grinned. He took a pencil and scribbled a word
on the paper. Then he stuck the paper in his hip
pocket, on top of his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll walk over to that boathouse,&rdquo; Biff said.
Halfway there, he stopped, pulled out his handkerchief,
and wiped his forehead. As he did so, the paper
fell to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he muttered. The boys entered the
boathouse. They pretended to examine the boats, allowing
themselves several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ve given our pursuer long enough, if we
are being followed,&rdquo; Biff decided.</p>
<p>They came back out of the boathouse and retraced
their steps. At the spot where Biff had pulled out his
handkerchief, he stopped again, and looked carefully
about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been followed, all right. The paper is
gone,&rdquo; Biff said to Li.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you write on that paper, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Lolo</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; Biff said, and the boys burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Time had slipped by much faster than Biff and Li
realized. It was midaftenoon when they got back to
the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve been so excited I forgot about eating,&rdquo;
Li said, &ldquo;but am I ever hungry now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could eat my way through another <i>luau</i>, Li,&rdquo;
Biff agreed.</p>
<p>At the front desk of the hotel, they found a message
from their fathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re checking out the boat</i>,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father had
written, &ldquo;<i>and getting supplies. Wait for us.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Li had a late lunch, took a small siesta,
then had a refreshing swim in the hotel&rsquo;s pool. It was
growing dark when Mr. Brewster and Hank Mahenili
came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the boat, Biff. And it&rsquo;s a real honey. As
trim a craft as you&rsquo;d ever want to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it, Dad?&rdquo; Biff wanted to see the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tied up at the municipal wharf. Know where that
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure do. We were down there this afternoon.
I wonder how we missed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff then told his father and Mr. Mahenili what he
and Li had learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt sure it would be Perez Soto. And he rented
a powerful cabin cruiser?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Dad. Li&rsquo;s <i>kamaaina</i> friend thinks it
was the Monday Dr. Weber disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all adds up. We can&rsquo;t get to Hawaii fast enough
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we leaving tonight?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten o&rsquo;clock. Have to wait until then for
supplies to be delivered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, is it all right if Li and I dash down to the dock
and look at the boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You&rsquo;ll have time. But don&rsquo;t stay too long.
We&rsquo;ll be having dinner in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Li started for the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Mr. Brewster called. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
you ought to know the boat&rsquo;s name? It&rsquo;s the <i>Easy
Action</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was growing dark when Biff and Li reached the
dock. There was the trim craft, painted a bright white,
with a golden arrow trimming its sides. Its two
masts swayed gently from side to side in the gently
rolling water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a beauty, all right,&rdquo; Biff said to Li as they
approached the boat. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff felt Li&rsquo;s hand on his arm, restraining him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it, Biff,&rdquo; Li said in a whisper. &ldquo;I think I
saw someone on the boat. Let&rsquo;s duck behind these
pineapple crates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys secreted themselves. They peered intently
at the yawl&rsquo;s portholes. There was barely enough
light to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, did you see that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head. They had seen a white-clad
figure flash by one of the portholes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />Bomb Away</h2>
<p>For several moments Biff and Li remained absolutely
quiet and motionless. They knew someone was on the
boat. But what was he doing?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he be one of the men bringing supplies to the
boat?&rdquo; Li whispered at last.</p>
<p>Biff shook his head. &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think so. You&rsquo;d
see activity on the deck, too, and a truck somewhere
nearby. No, we&rsquo;ve got to investigate what that character
is doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it, Li.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look, you know how well I can swim under
water. Suppose I slip into the water on this side of
the wharf. Then I&rsquo;ll swim under it, and I can come up
right beside the boat. I&rsquo;ll move along from porthole to
porthole and see if I can find out what&rsquo;s going on in
the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds okay to me. Good thing we changed into
shorts. Be careful not to make any noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, Biff? I&rsquo;ll be as quiet as a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was, too. There wasn&rsquo;t even the faintest &ldquo;ker-plop&rdquo;
as Li lowered himself over the edge of the dock
and sank into the water.</p>
<p>Biff waited tensely. From behind his stack of pineapple
crates, he could get a good view of the starboard
side of the yawl. He could see right to the water line
and the four portholes just above it.</p>
<p>Moments became minutes, and it seemed to Biff that
the minutes were stretching out much too long. Had
Li met some obstruction beneath the dock? Biff&rsquo;s
worry was increasing. Finally, he noticed a circle of
lightly rippling water near the bow of the boat. In
the center of the circle, he could just spot Li&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>He watched as his friend slowly raised himself by
the boat&rsquo;s starboard gunnel until his head was even
with the porthole. Noiselessly, Li dropped back into
the water and took two strokes toward the stern.
Now he peered into the second porthole. He repeated
the process at the third porthole and moved on to the
fourth. The fourth must be the one, Biff figured,
that was in the small compartment where the yawl&rsquo;s
auxiliary engine was located.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Li took a longer time at this porthole. Biff watched
him intently through the growing darkness. A slight
movement on the boat caused him to raise his eyes.
He gasped.</p>
<p>Directly over Li stood a man with a small nail keg
raised over his head. He was ready to smash it down
on Li&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li! Look out! Duck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hawaiian boy submerged just as the keg struck
the water at the exact spot where his head had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers,&rdquo; Biff thought, &ldquo;I hope Li got far enough
under.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keg hurler was running along the deck toward
the boat&rsquo;s bow. Here he could leap on the dock
and make his getaway.</p>
<p>Biff went into action. He jumped from behind the
crates, reached the boat in six fast strides, and leaped
aboard just as the prowler reached the bow.</p>
<p>Biff grabbed at the man. His arms encircled him,
and Biff in turn felt the man&rsquo;s arms squeeze him in a
bearlike hug. Biff exerted every ounce of his strength,
trying to force the man over backward, trying to free
himself of the man&rsquo;s crushing grip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>He heard a noise from directly behind the man.
Looking over his shoulder, Biff saw the dripping figure
of Li scramble aboard. Li didn&rsquo;t hesitate. He
threw himself at the man, striking him just at the
knees from the rear. &ldquo;Clipping,&rdquo; flashed through Biff&rsquo;s
mind. Unfair in football, but in a fight like this there&rsquo;d
be no fifteen-yard penalty.</p>
<p>The impact of Li&rsquo;s body forced the man to release
his grip. As he did, Biff stepped backward. His feet
became entangled in a coil of rope. He lost his balance,
toppling backward. His feet hit the raised gunnel,
and the next moment he was flying through the
air. He felt himself falling, a sickening feeling, as if
he were falling from a great height. He wasn&rsquo;t,
though. He was falling from the bow, six feet to the
water. But he was falling backward and had no time
sense of the distance.</p>
<p>He hit the water with a splash. His broad back
smacked the water with the noise of a loud handclap.
Biff could feel his back sting from the impact.</p>
<p>He turned over and looked up. There was the bow
of the boat, directly overhead. There was Li, looking
down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all right, Biff?&rdquo; There was a strange sound in
Li&rsquo;s voice. For a moment, Biff was angered. The
strange sound was Li trying to hold back his laughter.
Biff&rsquo;s sense of humor came to his rescue. He must
have been a funny sight, thrashing around in the
water on his back like a beached porpoise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swim to midships.
You can give me a hand up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once back aboard, Biff&rsquo;s first concern was about
the prowler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, him,&rdquo; Li said. &ldquo;When you made your backward
bellywhopper, that guy took off. He raced
down the dock. He&rsquo;s long gone by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff rubbed the small of his back with his left hand.
&ldquo;That hurt. And here you are laughing at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were funny, Biff,&rdquo; Li laughed. &ldquo;And that
sting won&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right. Hey, let&rsquo;s see if we can find out
what our visitor was doing on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First the boys explored the deck of the boat. They
opened the sail-chest and inspected the sails. They
hadn&rsquo;t been touched. They carefully examined the
yawl&rsquo;s rigging. Both knew that an important rope
could be cut just far enough through so that it would
hold in a mild wind, then snap in a heavy one, just
when it was most badly needed. No evidence of any
tampering with the rigging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go below. That&rsquo;s where the prowler was
when we got here. He must have been doing his dirty
work down there,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>A careful search of the cabins, each with two
berths, revealed nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, look at this!&rdquo; Li called. He was in the engine
compartment, a small space between the forward
cabin and the galley. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look to you as if this
has been moved recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li pointed to the wooden cover which housed the
engine. It was sitting slightly askew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a look underneath.&rdquo; Biff took one side
of the housing, Li the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful now. Heave gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They removed the housing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a flashlight around here somewhere. Have
to have one if we&rsquo;re going to find anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li found one in the tool chest.</p>
<p>Biff took it and directed its beam of light on the
top of the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice little engine. A four-cylinder Indian Marine.
Ought to shove us along around eight or ten knots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed the light&rsquo;s beam over the engine, inch by
inch. Suddenly he brought the light&rsquo;s rays to a fixed
spot. Biff bent low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw anything like this on one of these engines.
Take a look, Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li bent down beside Biff.</p>
<p>The boys were looking at a crudely made object,
resembling a small tin can. It was roughly attached
just below the engine&rsquo;s carburetor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; Biff said, swallowing. His
throat had become dry and tight. &ldquo;That thing&rsquo;s a
bomb&mdash;a homemade bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Li was already heading back to the cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alloo there! Ship ahoy!&rdquo; came a cry from the
dock.</p>
<p>Biff and Li burst on deck just as his father and
Mr. Mahenili started to step aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay back, Dad! Stay back! There&rsquo;s a bomb on
the boat!&rdquo; Biff yelled.</p>
<p>Breathlessly, the boys told their fathers of spotting
the prowler on board, of the brief tussle, and the results
of their investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing we came down,&rdquo; Tom Brewster
said. &ldquo;You were late. We thought you might have run
up against something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure did, Dad,&rdquo; Biff assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to investigate. Can you tell me exactly
where this thing you think is a bomb is located?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going on board, are you, Dad?&rdquo; Biff
asked, his voice filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will be all right. I have an idea that bomb
isn&rsquo;t intended to go off while the boat&rsquo;s still in harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dad, it might,&rdquo; Biff protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff, I&rsquo;ve handled dynamite and other types of explosives
in my work. I was also in the bomb demolition
service in the army. I can handle it. You stay
back, though, all of you, until I give you an all-clear.
Now just where is this thing you found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directly under the carburetor,&rdquo; Biff replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you&rsquo;ll need this.&rdquo; He handed his father the
flashlight.</p>
<p>They watched Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s head disappear as he
moved down the steps from the cockpit to the first
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better follow your father&rsquo;s orders,
boys,&rdquo; Hank Mahenili said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put a little distance
between us and the boat&mdash;just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three moved an anchor rope&rsquo;s length from the
stem of the boat.</p>
<p>The minutes went by. The waiting became almost
unbearable. Biff couldn&rsquo;t control the feeling of fear
gnawing at the pit of his stomach. Any moment, he
expected to hear the dull thud of an explosion. He expected
to see the boat burst open, sending wood and
debris flying through the air.</p>
<p>Minutes ticked on. Each one seemed an hour to
Biff. At last, he saw his father emerge from the cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it. It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff ran to where his father stood. It may have been
all right, but Biff could tell by the beads of perspiration
standing out on his father&rsquo;s forehead and by his
soaked shirt, that it had been a ticklish job.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bomb, all right. Perez Soto is playing for
keeps,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said grimly. He wiped his forehead.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a simple thing, really. Anyone with Perez
Soto&rsquo;s experience, or mine, for that matter, could make
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when was it set to go off?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would depend on when and how long we
used the auxiliary engine. See this timer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three leaned forward for a closer look, peering
warily at the infernal machine Biff&rsquo;s father held in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This timer, which is hooked up to the detonator,
is fixed so it starts in motion when the engine is
started. It cuts out when the engine is out. Very
clever, actually, even though it is simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When would the timer fire the charge?&rdquo; Biff
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d judge after about an hour, perhaps two&mdash;no
more&mdash;after the engine had been running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d be out in the middle of the ocean by then.&rdquo;
Biff looked at Li and Mr. Mahenili. Both shook their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that, Biff, if I&rsquo;ve got it figured right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Perez Soto would know that we&rsquo;d use the
engine to get us out of the harbor. Maybe a twenty-minute
run. Then we&rsquo;d go to sail. And we&rsquo;d use sail
every minute we could. But then&mdash;this is the really
devilish clever part of his plan.&rdquo; Mr. Brewster paused.
He turned to Li&rsquo;s father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that there are some dangerous
reefs off Ka Lae?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet there are,&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili said. &ldquo;And
the water&rsquo;s shark-infested, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to search the coast along there for Huntington&rsquo;s
sunken sloop, we&rsquo;d have to use the engine.
Couldn&rsquo;t take a chance with sail on those ragged coral
reefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to catch on, Dad,&rdquo; Biff said soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to use the engine, as you said. And right
in the midst of those reefs, and those sharks, <i>bang</i>!
The boat would have blown up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that would have been the end of us,&rdquo;
Thomas Brewster said quietly. He tossed the deactivated
bomb overboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest in pieces,&rdquo; Biff said fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />A Near Miss</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Everything all clear?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster called out
from his position at the tiller in the yawl, <i>Easy Action</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; Biff called back to his father. Biff
held on to the bow line, loosely circled over a piling
at the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast off, then,&rdquo; Tom Brewster ordered.</p>
<p>Biff flicked the rope, snaking it over the piling, as
the <i>Easy Action</i> was cleared. Biff heard the low
growl of the reverse gear as his father backed easily
away from the wharf. A shift to forward, the engine
revved up higher, and the yawl headed out of the
harbor at Hana.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>It was a clear night, bright stars lighting up the
skies over the Hawaiian Islands. A slight sliver of a
new moon could just be seen rising in the east.</p>
<p>The yawl ran on its auxiliary engine for fifteen minutes,
putting the harbor behind it. When they were
well clear, and in open sea, Mr. Brewster cut the
engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hands to,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Prepare to hoist sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A yawl is a fore-and-aft rigged vessel. It has a large
mainmast forward, and a much smaller mast set abaft
or behind the tiller, or wheel.</p>
<p>Hank Mahenili and his son Li had hold of the halyards
at the mainmast, ready to pull on the lines to
raise the main and jib sails.</p>
<p>Biff would handle the mizzen or aft sail by himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave away, me hearties,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster ordered.</p>
<p>The three &ldquo;hearties&rdquo; heaved, and the sails slid up
their masts, and billowed gently out, catching a soft,
warm wind. The sails were set and trimmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Biff, you take over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff came into the cockpit and took the tiller over
from his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her headed as she is now. The compass setting
is for Upolu Point. We ought to make it easily
by daybreak, and then we&rsquo;ll cruise the western coast
of the Big Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heading for Ka Lae, Dad?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff. Hank and I are going to turn
in now. You and Li handle the ten-to-two watch.
Wake us up at two, then you boys can grab some
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li joined Biff in the cockpit.</p>
<p>The <i>Easy Action</i> lived up to her name. She slid
effortlessly through the water, noiseless except for the
soft swish of her bow cleaving a path. The wind held
steady. There was nothing to do but hold her on
course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like sailing, Li?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the greatest. I&rsquo;ll take sail over power any day.&rdquo;
Li spoke as if he were an old salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good for water skiing, though,&rdquo; Biff said.
&ldquo;You need more speed for that, quick speed, fast
starts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure. But for a cruise like we&rsquo;re taking, give me
sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were quiet. The spell of the night settled
over them. Li, Biff knew, dozed off from time to
time. He himself felt drowsy, lulled into sleepiness by
the slight rise and fall of the craft as it rode over the
swells.</p>
<p>Biff looked at the luminous dial of his watch. It
was nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock. He nudged the sleeping
Li.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re supposed to be on this watch with
me. How &rsquo;bout taking over for a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li rubbed his eyes, stretched, and yawned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Captain.&rdquo; He took the tiller.</p>
<p>Biff stood up, stretched his body, then settled into a
more comfortable position. He fought off sleep, but
knew he dozed now and again in short, five-minute
catnaps. He was never far from consciousness,
though. And if anything happened&mdash;say a quickening
of the wind&mdash;he would have been alert immediately.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock, a widely yawning Tom Brewster
emerged from the cabin, followed by Hank Mahenili.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, boys. We&rsquo;ll take over now. Get some
sleep. At this steady pace, we&rsquo;ll reach Upolu long before
daylight. We&rsquo;ll drop anchor, then set out again
at daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upolu is the northernmost point on the Island of
Hawaii.</p>
<p>Biff and Li were asleep the moment they hit their
berths. It seemed to Biff he had only just gone to sleep
when he felt his father shaking his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise and shine, Biff. Almost daylight. We&rsquo;re shoving
off as soon as we have some grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under a bright morning sun, the <i>Easy Action</i> got
under way again. Biff was at the tiller. His father and
Hank Mahenili, tired from their early morning watch,
dozed on the foredeck in comfortable captain&rsquo;s chairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Biff and Li had their work cut out for them. The
course set was a zigzag one. They wanted to cruise
as much of the coastline as possible in the hope of
spotting some sign of Huntington&rsquo;s sunken sloop.</p>
<p>Biff would head the <i>Easy Action</i> off shore, run out
nearly ten miles, then tack back in. For every three
miles they progressed down the coast toward Ka
Lae, the southern tip of Hawaii, they covered nearly
twenty miles out and back from the coast.</p>
<p>A stiff morning breeze sent the <i>Easy Action</i> skipping
briskly over the waves. They had covered a
good distance by eight bells, twelve o&rsquo;clock noon.</p>
<p>Biff and Li took turns at the tiller. When Li was the
steerer, Biff stood on the highest point of the foredeck,
near the ship&rsquo;s bow, scanning the waters on
either side with powerful binoculars. When it was his
time to take over the wheel, Li took up the vigil.</p>
<p>They reached Kailua on the Kona coast as the sun,
like a blazing ball, settled into the Pacific Ocean to the
west. They were halfway to Ka Lae, the southern
cape.</p>
<p>The party went ashore for a steak dinner at the famous
Kona Steak House, then came back to their boat
filled with food and tired. All turned in at once. No
watch was set. None of them saw the black-hulled
power cruiser come in and drop its anchor nearby.
Then the captain of the cruiser, having spotted the
<i>Easy Action</i>, weighed anchor and moved off to an
anchorage out of sight from the crew of the yawl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The next morning the search was continued, the
yawl weaving its way in and out along the coast,
drawing nearer to Ka Lae, nearer to the position at
which Huntington had last been heard from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the tiller now, Biff,&rsquo;&rdquo; his father said.
&ldquo;Hank and I will alternate. I want you and Li to
keep a constant watch. Your young eyes are sharper
than ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Easy Action</i> spent the day crisscrossing a wide
area of water between the shore line and a distance
outside the coral shoals, varying from five to twelve
miles.</p>
<p>Nightfall found them off Ka Lae, or South Cape.
They anchored in thirty feet of clear water, about a
quarter of a mile off shore. They could see the white
combers lashing at the rocky formation of the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll combine our evening meal with a council of
war,&rdquo; Tom Brewster said, once the ship was made
tight for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You figure we&rsquo;re in the danger area now, Dad?&rdquo;
Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huntington&rsquo;s sloop is on the bottom of the ocean
somewhere in this area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Perez Soto is looking for it just as hard as
we are,&rdquo; Hank Mahenili added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Dr. Weber?&rdquo; Biff asked. &ldquo;Do you
think he&rsquo;s aboard Perez Soto&rsquo;s boat, or do you think
he&rsquo;s being held on shore?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to say, Biff. My feeling is that he&rsquo;s being
held on shore. A captive on a boat could be too easily
spotted at a refueling wharf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Dad, that we ought to divide up
now?&rdquo; Biff suggested. &ldquo;Two of us make a shore
search for Dr. Weber, the other two cruise around
and try to spot the sunken sloop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, Biff. We&rsquo;ll do that tomorrow,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster agreed. &ldquo;Hank and I will go ashore. You
and Li conduct the sea search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That suited Biff and Li just fine. They looked at
one another and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tonight, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to have
a standing watch. There&rsquo;s been no sign of Perez Soto
so far. But one of us ought to sleep on deck. Any
volunteers?&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, Dad.&rdquo; Biff jumped at the chance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.
Nice warm night. The sleeping will be better under
the stars than it will be in the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s all turn in. Big day ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff spread out a sleeping bag on the <i>Easy Action</i>&rsquo;s
foredeck. He lay on his back, his eyes staring up and
the millions of stars twinkling in the sky overhead.
The sound of the surf came distinctly. It was a soothing
sound, and shortly Biff was lulled to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Some hours later, he was awakened slowly. He
heard the distant throb of a powerful engine. At first,
Biff thought it must be an airplane. But then, as he
became wider awake, he realized the throbbing came
not from the air, but the sea. It grew louder as the
craft, whatever it was, drew nearer.</p>
<p>Biff sat up, propping himself on one arm. Now
there was no mistaking it. A boat, one with a powerful
engine, was rapidly approaching the <i>Easy Action</i>&rsquo;s
anchorage. Biff stood up. He peered into the starlight
night. He could see the reflection of stars twinkling on
the water&rsquo;s surface. Then he made out the outlines of a
cabin cruiser throwing a fan-tail white wake, heading
fast toward the <i>Easy Action</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fools,&rdquo; Biff muttered to himself, &ldquo;if they don&rsquo;t
change course, they&rsquo;ll ram us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew the white-hulled yawl was sharply outlined
against the starlit waters. Then he suddenly
knew what was happening. The on-charging cruiser
was aiming at the yawl. It <i>meant</i> to ram her.</p>
<p>Biff raised a cry. It was too late. His voice was
drowned out by the roar of the cruiser&rsquo;s engines&mdash;Biff
knew now that it was a twin-engined craft.</p>
<p>Now the boat seemed on top of the yawl. Its bow,
with a much higher freeboard than the low-lying
yawl, reared up menacingly only twenty feet from
the sailing craft. Surely it would crash them, ram
them, send them to the bottom of the sea, with Biff&rsquo;s
father, Hank Mahenili, and Li trapped below.</p>
<p>Biff yelled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>At the last moment, the cruiser swerved sharply to
the starboard, making an almost right-angle turn. It
roared alongside the <i>Easy Action</i>, not ten feet separating
the two boats.</p>
<p>As the cruiser made its fast, skidding turn, it threw
up a tremendous wave. Biff saw the wave sweeping
toward the yawl. Then, tons of foaming water
cascaded over the <i>Easy Action</i>. Biff grabbed for the
mainmast, wrapping his arms around it in a death
lock. He felt the wave tugging at his body. It took all
his strength to prevent being swept overboard.</p>
<p>The wave passed on over, tumbling gallons of
water into the cabins below.</p>
<p>Biff released his grip on the mainmast. He sprinted
to the cockpit. It was nearly filled with water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad! Dad! You all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to plunge into the water-filled cabin and
was met by his father, Hank, and Li fighting their
way out, gasping for breath, trying to expel water
from their choked lungs.</p>
<p>The black cruiser had sped away, the throb of its
engines barely audible now.</p>
<p>Everyone was all right. But what a mess! Bedding
was soaked. Galley equipment, pots, pans, dishes had
been swept off shelves, some of the pans bobbing like
corks in the swirling waters inside the ship&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Biff went into action. Maybe he could start the
engine before the water did its damage. He splashed
through the water and reached the engine compartment.
He pulled open the door. It had held back the
flood from the engine room. Before the water could
rush in and fill up that compartment, Biff had the engine
going. He quickly turned on the yawl&rsquo;s sea
pumps. He stood there with his fingers crossed, hoping
the engine wouldn&rsquo;t conk out. It didn&rsquo;t. The
heavy-duty pumps worked perfectly. Already the
water inside the boat was beginning to recede.</p>
<p>Biff joined his father, Hank Mahenili, and Li in the
cockpit. They were still dazed and only now beginning
to breathe easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was going to ram us, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get it now,&rdquo; Biff continued. &ldquo;To ram us would
have damaged <i>his</i> boat&mdash;put it out of commission,
even if it didn&rsquo;t sink. He wanted to swamp us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nearly did!&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili said.</p>
<p>The steady beat of the pumps continued. They
were rapidly bailing the yawl out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Biff, you know what we&rsquo;re really up against
now,&rdquo; his father said seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I always did, Dad. This Perez Soto will
stop at nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li sat quietly, but he was shaking as if from a chill.
It was the recent frightening experience which caused
him to tremble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, I&rsquo;ve been in and around water, in and out of
boats all my life. But that was the nearest brush I&rsquo;ve
ever had with a watery grave.&rdquo; Hank Mahenili&rsquo;s voice
was solemn. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never get away with it,&rdquo; he added
fiercely.</p>
<p>The next hour was spent in straightening up the
water damage. Bedding was brought on deck and
spread to dry. Li was elected cook, to make coffee and
hot tea. Dawn was spreading before the <i>Easy Action</i>
was shipshape again.</p>
<p>After a hot meal, Mr. Brewster took Biff aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff, we&rsquo;re not going to let last night&rsquo;s incident
change our plans. Hank and I are going ashore immediately.
You and Li put out and start the search at
once. We&rsquo;ve got to stop Perez Soto before he stops
us. Come below with me for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff followed his father into the cabin. He saw him
open his bag. When he turned around, he was holding
a revolver in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how to use this, Biff. You&rsquo;ve practiced
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to use it, except in the most extreme
emergency. You&rsquo;re to use it only to repel anyone trying
to board this boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head gravely. Mr. Brewster replaced
the weapon and left the cabin to join Hank
Mahenili. Biff and Li watched their fathers as they
headed for shore in the yawl&rsquo;s dinghy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />Storm!</h2>
<p>The boys watched the dinghy plunge into the surf
near the shore. They saw it picked up by a breaking
roller, and carried on its crest to the shore. They saw
the two men pull the dinghy high up on the shore and
hide it behind some low, spreading growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking no chances,&rdquo; Biff said to Li.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be equally careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s voice held a grim tone. The memory of the
night before was still vivid in his mind. Li&rsquo;s face was
solemn, too, his round brown eyes serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the captain, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff smiled. He didn&rsquo;t want Li to become too
alarmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, my friend. Let&rsquo;s put out to sea. I can handle
the mainsail and the jib. You stand by the tiller. We&rsquo;ll
hoist the mizzen after we&rsquo;re heading out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff ran the mainsail up, leaped to the bow of the
boat, and started hauling in the anchor on a hand
winch. It took a lot of effort. The anchor was heavy,
and he had to raise it thirty feet. The <i>Easy Action</i>, a
spanking off-shore breeze in its sail, was already
plowing through the sea before Biff had the anchor
safely stowed.</p>
<p>Once the anchor was stowed, Biff went back to the
cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;m I doing, Biff? Heading the right way?&rdquo; Li
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Point her a little more to the southwest. I&rsquo;ll raise
the mizzen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff finished his seaman&rsquo;s job and dropped down in
the cockpit beside Li for a breather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take over now, Li. You go forward and be
the lookout. Take the binoculars,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>All morning they continued their crisscrossing
course. The high noon sun blazed down on them. The
heat soon dried the bedding. Biff heaved to long
enough to carry the bedding below and make up the
berths.</p>
<p>They had a sandwich, then stretched out on the hot
deck for a brief rest. The boat drifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think we are now, Li?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Li looked shoreward. They could just make out the
coastline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve rounded Ka Lae. Must be just off the
black sand beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Black</i> sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Biff. The lava from Kilauea spilled down to
the ocean. The surf ground it up into a fine black powder,
really finer than sand. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the
black sand beach. It&rsquo;s all along the Puna coast, all the
way up to Hilo&mdash;that&rsquo;s a city on the west side of
the Big Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to change course, then. Head a
point or two north by northeast. Then we&rsquo;ll wing
back east and return to the anchorage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li was at the tiller. He came about, and the <i>Easy
Action</i> was put on a long reach, pushed briskly along
by a southerly wind.</p>
<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon, Biff looked
up to see Li coming aft. Biff was at the tiller. He
noticed a frown on his Hawaiian friend&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Li? You sight something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Biff,&rdquo; Li shook his head. The serious expression
on his face had deepened to one of worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s your trouble? You look like you got
trouble.&rdquo; Biff smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we both may have,&rdquo; Li answered.
&ldquo;Have you noticed it getting any warmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, perhaps. Wind&rsquo;s freshened a bit, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re in for some Kona
weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kona weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what we call a wind coming up from
the Equator. Sometimes it reaches gale force. Always
there&rsquo;s heavy rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked astern. On the southern horizon, he
could make out huge thunderheads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there a Kona wind when Huntington was
lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A big one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better get out of here fast. We&rsquo;ll try
to get back round Ka Lae. The Point ought to give
us some protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no doubt now that a Kona wind was
catching them. Biff changed course again. He headed
<i>Easy Action</i>&rsquo;s bow west by north. The wind rose
rapidly. It whistled through the sails, making the rigging
lines vibrate. The sea began kicking up.</p>
<p>The wind drove <i>Easy Action</i> before it. The yawl
heeled far over, its mainsail stretched taut on the starboard
side. The yawl was fairly racing through the
water.</p>
<p>Suddenly they were struck by a torrential downpour.
The rain hit the deck in drops as big as half-dollars.
The sky had blackened. The shore was
blanked out. Angry whitecaps dotted the water like
blobs of cotton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="Sailboat in heavy seas." width="800" height="418" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take the tiller, Li,&rdquo; Biff shouted above the roar of
the wind and the pounding of the rain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
get the mainsail down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff fought his way forward on the rain-slippery
deck. He was pushed along by the driving wind. He
reached the mainmast. Its lines were whipping against
it, cracking like pistol shots. He loosened the mainsail
halyard. The wind grabbed the mainsail. Biff
struggled to pull it down. Suddenly there was a thunderous
crack. The mainsail gave way, torn loose from
its halyards. It stretched straight out like a flat, white
canopy and flapped violently in the wind, which was
now near gale force.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>There was no way to cut it loose. Biff let the line
go. The jibsail was still holding. Turning, Biff felt the
rain and salt spray beat against his face. He had to
bend into a crouch to make any progress aft. The salt
spray stung his eyes, nearly blinding him.</p>
<p>Once he slipped and crashed to the deck. He could
feel himself sliding toward the starboard gunnel, now
nearly under water because the yawl had heeled over
so far. A last-second grab at a mooring stanchion
saved him from going overboard into the boiling sea.</p>
<p>Biff pulled himself up slowly. He crawled on hands
and knees and fell exhausted into the cockpit. For
moments he lay there, gasping for breath. Then he
saw the fear on Li&rsquo;s face. Li held the tiller in a viselike
grip. Biff rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take over,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Li merely nodded his head in assent, glad to relinquish
the wooden tiller handle. It was a fight to
hold it steady.</p>
<p>From forward, the boys heard another crack, sharp
as a shotgun shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jibsail&rsquo;s given away,&rdquo; Biff shouted.</p>
<p>Now their only control of the yawl was by the
mizzensail. It was behind them, making control of the
boat most difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the mizzen goes,&rdquo; Biff yelled, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re done for!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Just as he spoke the words, the mizzen gave way,
torn from its halyard by a sudden driving gust. At the
same moment, the boys heard a sound that sent an
even greater chill of fear racing up and down their
spines. It was the roar of an angry surf pounding the
shore.</p>
<p>They were being swept ashore. The boat would be
dashed to bits. They would be flung on razor-sharp
coral!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get forward, Li,&rdquo; Biff shouted. &ldquo;Let the anchor
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of the pounding surf came nearer. Biff
prayed that the anchor would grab and hold. He
fought the tiller, trying to keep the yawl from being
swept ashore broadside. Then, suddenly, the yawl was
lifted high on the crest of a roller, as if handled by a
giant. When it crashed down into a churning trough
of water, Biff&rsquo;s grasp on the tiller was torn loose. He
felt himself being hurled through the air. Then he
struck the water with a thud, knocking the wind
from his lungs.</p>
<p>Biff felt himself go under. Then he was lifted by
another roller. Surfacing, he gasped for air. His arms
flailed the water. The waves tossed him about, carrying
him nearer and nearer the shore. Biff struggled to
ride the waves, to keep control of his body so that he
might avoid being dashed on the shore. He was hoping
against hope that this would be a sand, not coral
beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>After a seemingly endless struggle, Biff, kicking
out, felt his feet touch bottom. Nothing had ever
felt so good before. His feet were touching a powdery
sand, now roiled up, but at least, it wasn&rsquo;t a
coral bottom.</p>
<p>Biff found himself in waist-deep water. The shoreline
was only a few feet in front of him. He staggered
through the surf, reached the black sand beach, and
threw himself face down on the sand. Every muscle
in his body felt as if it had been pounded, pummeled,
pulled, and strained.</p>
<p>Then he thought of Li. He turned over and rose to
his knees. He saw the <i>Easy Action</i>. Her anchor had
caught and held. She was pounding up and down on
the rough waters, but Biff could see that she was
holding.</p>
<p>But where was Li?</p>
<p>Biff stood up. He went to the water&rsquo;s edge. He
walked out until the water raced around his knees.
Cupping his hands to his mouth, he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li! Li!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />Men Missing</h2>
<p>Biff stood on the beach calling out his friend&rsquo;s name
again and again. His voice shook with effort, trying to
drown out the noises of surf and sea.</p>
<p>The wind was dying down slightly, but the surf
was still too rough and dangerous for Biff to try to
reach the boat, which stood one hundred feet off shore.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s eyes searched the beach, hoping to spot Li
swimming ashore. No such welcome sight met his
eyes.</p>
<p>To his left, about a quarter of a mile away, Biff
could see a formation of lava rock jutting out into the
sea. He thought his friend Li might have gotten to
shore on the other side of the lava promontory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Biff ran down the beach. His pounding heart sank
when he reached the ugly, grayish-black rock,
stretching out into the sea. Its side was smooth, rising
upward some thirty feet. There was no place Biff
could spot where he could gain a foothold to climb
to its top.</p>
<p>Around the base of the lava cliff, the water dashed
and swirled, making it impossible for Biff to swim
around to the other side.</p>
<p>Biff went back to the spot on the beach directly
opposite the <i>Easy Action</i>. He sank down on the wet
sand, filled with despair. He felt certain now that his
good friend Li must be lost in the ocean.</p>
<p>Night settled over a lonely, saddened Biff. The
rain had stopped. The wind was dying down. The
surf was losing some of its angry roar. Sleep, a sleep
Biff felt he could never attain, finally came to the
tired, worried boy. With it came release for his
troubled mind.</p>
<p>By morning, the wind was gone. The sea was
smooth, and the sky was blue over Hawaii once
again.</p>
<p>Biff saw the yawl rocking gently at its anchor. Its
sails torn, tattered, drooped from the masts like the
banners of a defeated army. There was no sign of Li.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to do. He must search
the nearby coast for his lost friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Biff swam out to the yawl. A quick inspection
showed the <i>Easy Action</i> to be a stout ship. She had
taken on little water. Her seams had held. Her masts
had stood the strain. Biff took out the emergency suit
of sail and rigged them to the halyards. He started
the engine, let it idle as he raised the anchor, then put
out to sea.</p>
<p>He ran on engine past the lava promontory, bringing
the boat as close into shore as he felt safe. No sign
of Li.</p>
<p>Biff put back out to sea, raised the jibsail and cruised
along the coast, his eyes constantly scanning the
shoreline. He didn&rsquo;t know how far down the Big
Island he sailed, but he dreaded turning about and
giving up. Finally, he felt he had to. He had to get
back to where he had left his father and Mr. Mahenili
and tell them the tragic news.</p>
<p>Biff came about. Now he sailed in the opposite
direction. He rounded the lava promontory, lashed
the tiller, and went forward to raise the mainsail.</p>
<p>Returning to the cockpit, Biff cast a final look at
the spot on the black beach where he had spent the
night. His heart leaped. There was someone on the
beach, jumping up and down, waving madly. Li!</p>
<p>With a shout of happiness, Biff turned the yawl inshore.
Li had already dashed into the water, and was
swimming toward the approaching boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Biff came about quickly, heading the yawl into the
wind. Li reached its side, and Biff pulled him aboard.
He threw his arms around Li&rsquo;s wet body and hugged
him in sheer happiness. Then he stepped back and
sized Li up carefully. Except for some scratches, and
a deep gash on one leg, Li looked fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were a goner,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, old Davy Jones hasn&rsquo;t got me in his locker
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened? Where&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li grinned. &ldquo;I fell overboard. I&rsquo;d just let go the
anchor when my foot got caught and I went over. A
current caught me and carried me away from the
boat. The anchor must have dragged for quite a distance
before it caught, because when I finally made
shore, the yawl wasn&rsquo;t in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you land? The other side of that lava
cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. And there was no way to get over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. I walked down the beach to the
cliff, but it can&rsquo;t be climbed from this side, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys were silent for a minute, thinking about
their narrow escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what did you do, Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started up the cliff, the side of it. I had to find
some way of getting over it, hoping to find you safe
on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was growing dark. I slipped several times,
cut myself, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see you did. We better put some antiseptic on
that cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already cleaned it out with salt water. Stung
like the dickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll still do some more doctoring. Now get on
with your story,&rdquo; Biff ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t make it at night, so I
found a protected spot and went to sleep. This morning,
I made my way farther up the cliff, found a place
where I could cross, and came over to this side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Biff. When I finally made it here, I could
have died. No Biff. No boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for you. I must have sailed two or
three miles down the coast, trying to spot you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I finally figured out, Biff. I thought
that since the boat was gone and there was no wreckage
on the beach, old E.A. hadn&rsquo;t smashed up. So,
putting my two heads together, I also figured you
must be safe and had gone hunting for me. So I just
sat and waited. Boy, when you rounded that promontory,
was I ever glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too, when I saw you jumping around like a
crazy Indian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys smiled at each other. Their smiles turned
to laughter, and for a few moments they let themselves
go in a wild laughing bout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should have known,&rdquo; Biff said, simmering down
at last. &ldquo;I should have known that Likake Mahenili,
champion swimmer of the Islands, could take care of
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was close, though, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff put the <i>Easy Action</i> on a course for the spot
where the dinghy had been beached. They sailed
through the morning and well into the afternoon before
they spotted their landmarks. Biff anchored the
yawl. Both had felt sure their parents would be waiting
for them on the beach. There was no sign of
either man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do now, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff shrugged his shoulders helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Li. All we can do is wait. It&rsquo;ll be
dark, soon. We can&rsquo;t search for them at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff, you don&rsquo;t think that maybe Perez Soto&mdash;&rdquo;
Li couldn&rsquo;t finish his sentence.</p>
<p>Biff knew the worried thoughts which must be
running through his friend&rsquo;s mind. The same thoughts
were racing through his own. Had his father and Mr.
Mahenili been trapped by the enemy?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />Held Prisoner</h2>
<p>High up the side of Mauna Loa volcano, Tom Brewster
and Hank Mahenili turned their binoculars on
the sea 10,000 feet below them and several miles
away.</p>
<p>The men scanned the coastline, inch by inch,
searching for any activity on the wide horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t spot the <i>Easy Action</i>, Hank. Can you?&rdquo;
Tom Brewster asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But look over there. To your right. Line up
on that tall palm tree, couple hundred feet down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Tom Brewster followed his friend&rsquo;s directions. He
adjusted his glasses. As the focus became sharp, he
spotted a black object, apparently a boat, anchored off
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t that be a black power boat? Looks like it
to me, Tom,&rdquo; Hank said.</p>
<p>Brewster studied the boat for a minute before replying.
&ldquo;I think it is. I&rsquo;m sure it is. That must be
Perez Soto&rsquo;s boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mahenili had turned his glasses in the direction
where the <i>Easy Action</i> should be riding at anchor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting worried about the boys, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll be all right. They&rsquo;ll be coming into
sight any moment now. Anything in particular worrying
you? We&rsquo;ve spotted Perez Soto&rsquo;s boat. They
haven&rsquo;t had any trouble with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was late afternoon. Hank Mahenili had turned
his glasses to the south, looking out over Ka Lae.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that cloud formation to the south?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s building up fast. It could be a Kona wind coming
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d better start down, then,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster
suggested.</p>
<p>The two men had descended only halfway down
the side of the volcano when the Kona storm struck.
They had to halt. It was too dangerous to make the
steep descent in the raging storm, the same storm that
had hit the <i>Easy Action</i> two hours earlier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The high wind, ripping and roaring, whining against
the side of the mountain, was followed by a sheet of
rain. Tom Brewster and Hank Mahenili had to scramble
for any cover they could find. They located a
small but deep depression, more of a pocket than a
cave, and dived into it. Water trickled in, wetting
them, but it was better than being in the open with
the rain and wind lashing at them.</p>
<p>Shortly after nightfall, the storm lessened. There
was no question of trying to continue their descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to make the best of it for the night,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the boys?&rdquo; Hank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing we can do, Hank. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m not
worried. I am. But I do trust Biff. He&rsquo;s been up against
many a tough situation and has always come through.
He will this time, too. And so will Li.&rdquo; Tom hoped his
strong tone of confidence would be imparted to his
friend. He knew that the Mahenilis weren&rsquo;t accustomed
to running into the dangerous situations that
had been a part of his own life for many years, and
recently, had become almost a pattern for Biff, too.</p>
<p>Henry Mahenili was made of stout stuff, too. He
also knew that, when faced with a situation where
there was no immediate out, the best thing to do was
to face up to it and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Tom Brewster changed the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea, Hank. I base it on seeing that black
power boat anchored off shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think that Perez Soto and whoever is working
with him must be ashore. I think they must have Dr.
Weber with them. It would be too easy to spot someone
being held captive in as confined a space as a
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you in that thinking, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me this, then. Don&rsquo;t you think they must
have a hideout somewhere nearby? They wouldn&rsquo;t
want to be too far from their anchorage. They&rsquo;d want
to be able to get to their boat quickly if any definite
news came about the location of Huntington&rsquo;s sunken
sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are all sorts of places around here, Tom.
Lean-tos, shacks. Finding one certain hideout won&rsquo;t
be simple. There&rsquo;s also a lot of the Mauna Loa, too.
Don&rsquo;t expect too much too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But I won&rsquo;t rest until I&rsquo;ve made every
effort to find Dr. Weber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, if we don&rsquo;t rest now, we won&rsquo;t have
the strength to continue our search. Let&rsquo;s try to get
some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent a restless night in their cramped, wet
quarters. Daylight, with a bright sun already sending
up steam vapors as it dried the wet mountain side,
was a welcome relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The first thing both men did was to scan the shore
line again with their binoculars, searching for the <i>Easy
Action</i>. Failure to spot her increased the worry in
both men&rsquo;s minds. Neither spoke of the matter. Each
knew how greatly concerned the other was. But there
was no point in dumping one worry upon another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Hank. Let&rsquo;s get back on down. The
boys may be there when we arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started on down the side of Mauna Loa. At
an elevation of about one thousand feet, almost directly
opposite the anchored black power boat, they
halted for a breather. They were only a mile or so
from the shore. Their intention was to cut to their
left, now that the going was easier at the lower altitude.
The descent was no longer so precipitate.</p>
<p>They headed almost due south now. They stayed
at the same elevation, stopping now and again to
sweep the coast line with their glasses. At one halt,
Tom Brewster placed a retaining hand on Mahenili
just as he started off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it a moment, Hank,&rdquo; Tom said in a low
voice. &ldquo;Hear anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hank Mahenili listened. In a few moments, he
nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound like voices to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And angry ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along then, let&rsquo;s find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices seemed to be coming from a point below
them, not too far below, and just a bit to their
right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>They proceeded most cautiously in the direction of
the voices, careful not to start any pebbles or small
stones rolling downward. Easing themselves down,
the two men came to a ledge. It projected out like the
roof of a shed or porch. Tom Brewster got down on
his stomach. He wormed his way forward. The voices
were coming, it appeared, from directly beneath him.</p>
<p>Inching ahead, Tom Brewster came to the edge of
the ledge. Carefully, he craned his head forward and
looked down. He saw the tops of two men&rsquo;s heads. A
third man was stretched out on a makeshift bed of
brush, covered with a worn cloth.</p>
<p>The third man was Dr. Weber. The doctor&rsquo;s cheeks
were sunken. His color was bad. He looked completely
ill and worn out. Towering over the doctor
was Perez Soto. Thomas Brewster couldn&rsquo;t see the
other man&rsquo;s face, but he knew it must have anger
written on it from the tone of his voice.</p>
<p>Dr. Weber groaned as he turned on his side. Brewster
could see that his hands were bound behind his
back. His ankles were also lashed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You old fool!&rdquo; Perez Soto said. &ldquo;Why should it
make any difference to you whether I get the cesium
or Brewster gets it? You&rsquo;re a scientist. Bah! A scientist
should put his science before all else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Brewster heard the doctor&rsquo;s reply in a voice barely
audible: &ldquo;There are certain things even a scientist
places a greater value on&mdash;friendship, loyalty, humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perez Soto leaned over the old man, his arm raised
as if to strike him. Brewster had all he could do to
keep himself from leaping off the ledge onto Perez
Soto&rsquo;s back. But Soto&rsquo;s henchman stood, gun in hand,
by the old man&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you this day, and no more, my fine doctor,&rdquo;
Perez Soto said. &ldquo;By nightfall, if you do not reveal to
me the location of the cesium strike, the world will
lose one of its most eminent scientists!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />A Dangerous Dive</h2>
<p>Biff and Li were up with the first rays of daylight.
After a hurried breakfast, they prepared to go ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s safe to leave the boat unguarded,
Biff?&rdquo; Li wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I know darn well that Perez Soto
would like nothing better than to find the <i>Easy Action</i>
with no one aboard and scuttle her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take that chance,&rdquo; Biff said grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to. Finding our fathers is more important than all the
yawls and all the cesium in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li smiled in agreement. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be awfully
wet when we get ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The dinghy was still secreted behind beach brush.
The yawl had no other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you kind of kick your way ashore, swimming
on your back, Li?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Biff. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s what you try to do. Jump overboard.
Turn on your back. I&rsquo;ll hand you some dry shorts and
sweat shirts. Hold them out of water over your head
and see if you can make shore that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Biff. But I don&rsquo;t know. Getting through
the surf isn&rsquo;t going to be easy. Probably get the
clothes wet anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it. And if they do get wet, the sun will
dry &rsquo;em fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li dived into the ocean. He plunged around like a
porpoise for a few moments, enjoying and getting the
feel of the water. Then he turned on his back and
kicked to the side of the yawl. Biff handed down a
bundle of clothing, and Li propelled himself away
from the boat with a powerful thrust against its side.</p>
<p>Biff slung a pair of binoculars in a waterproof case
around his neck and slipped into the water.</p>
<p>Li&rsquo;s progress was slow. His leg thrusts were those
of an excellent backstroke swimmer, but unable to use
his arms, he couldn&rsquo;t go very fast. Biff stayed alongside
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going ahead when we reach the shore breakers,&rdquo;
Biff called to Li. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taller than you. Maybe I
can reach bottom, and take the clothes from you before
a wave rolls over you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a good plan. But the sea has a way of upsetting
good plans, and it did this time. Boys and
clothes reached shore equally wet. They wrung out
their shorts and sweat shirts as best they could, donned
them, and headed up the southern slope of the Mauna
Loa in the area called Kau.</p>
<p>They toiled upward, resting at regular intervals. It
was hot, tiring work. Their wet clothes clung to their
bodies. Perspiration from the effort kept their clothes
damp. Even in the heat, Biff found himself shivering
convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a clammy feeling from these clothes.
Guess that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m shivering,&rdquo; Biff said to his
friend. He hoped it <i>was</i> the damp clothing, rather
than fear for the safety of his father and Hanale Mahenili.</p>
<p>By noon, the boys had climbed nearly three thousand
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a break,&rdquo; Biff called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By me, fine. That was a tough climb,&rdquo; Li answered.</p>
<p>Biff stretched out. Li remained seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have the glasses. Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff handed them over, shielded his eyes from the
sun, and tried to catch a catnap. He was just dozing
off when he felt Li nudge him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Biff! Biff!&rdquo; The excitement in Li&rsquo;s voice brought
Biff to a sitting position in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there, see? About halfway between Ka Lae
and that point to the north&mdash;Kauna Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But how can I see anything without the
glasses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li unslung them from around his neck and handed
them to Biff. &ldquo;Now, look. Follow the direction of my
arm. About half a mile, I&rsquo;d guess, off shore. Almost
exactly between Ka Lae and Kauna Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m following you, Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move your glasses around in a tight area of a few
hundred yards. See if you spot a dark object on the
bottom of the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were looking almost straight down. From
his many flights over water, Biff knew that from
above, one could see through the water to depths of
forty to fifty feet with ease. The water acted as a
magnifying glass.</p>
<p>He moved the glasses in a tight circle. Then he
spotted what had caused all Li&rsquo;s excitement. Lying on
the bottom of the ocean was a dark object. It was
slender, about forty feet long, Biff judged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it could be, Biff? Think it could be a
boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff didn&rsquo;t want to raise either his own or Li&rsquo;s hopes
too high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it be a coral formation, Li?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I don&rsquo;t think so, Biff. There&rsquo;d be more then
one formation of coral around. It&rsquo;s mighty rare to find
just a sliver stuck out somewhere in the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it could be a boat! A boat on the bottom of
the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huntington&rsquo;s boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be, Li. But let&rsquo;s not get our hopes up too
high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s get back to the <i>Easy Action</i> and
cruise over there. We&rsquo;ve got to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before agreeing, Biff thought about his father and
Hank Mahenili. Should the boys continue the search?
After all, the same storm that had forced him and Li
to spend the night ashore could well have caused the
fathers to take shelter. Perhaps their parents even now
were back at the beach opposite the anchorage, or
even aboard the yawl. Biff made his decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Li. Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>The boys reached the beach opposite the <i>Easy Action</i>&rsquo;s
anchorage in half the time it had taken them to
make the ascent. Downhill, all the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the dinghy out,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do
our parents any good if the yawl isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their haste matched the excitement growing inside
them about their find. Of course, both knew they
could be in for a great disappointment. Biff pushed
that depressing thought out of his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Li upped anchor while Biff got the engine started,
then went to the cockpit. Biff took the tiller and
pointed the yawl&rsquo;s bow directly out to sea. With a
careful eye, he measured the distance from shore until
he was sure he was about half a mile out. Then he put
the helm of the <i>Easy Action</i> hard over to the starboard
and cruised parallel to the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;ve got that spot well marked in your
mind, Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure have, Biff. Remember when we spotted it?
There was a large, oval patch of whitish lava just to
the left of where we were resting. I&rsquo;m sure we can
spot it from the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. You be the lookout. I&rsquo;m going to keep this
boat on as true a course as I can. I think we&rsquo;re just
about as far off shore now as we figured that sunken
boat was. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks right to me. What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take the glasses. Keep them turned on the
Mauna Loa slope. Soon as you pick up that oval lava
patch, sing out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li went forward with the binoculars. He kept them
trained shoreward, aiming them about two thousand
feet up the slope.</p>
<p>The distance to the spot the boys had in mind was
greater than they had thought it to be. They covered
a lot of water. Biff checked his watch. He hoped they
could spot the sunken hulk before the light went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Land ho!&rdquo; Li sang out and came racing back over
the deck to the cockpit. &ldquo;Oval patch coming into
sight, captain. Here, take the glasses and see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff turned the tiller over to Li and took a look.
That was the patch, all right. It was off their starboard
bow, still a good two miles ahead. Biff revved
up the engine, and the <i>Easy Action</i>&rsquo;s auxiliary pushed
the yawl along at a good eight knots. In twenty minutes&mdash;Biff
timed the run, figuring the miles the yawl
would cover at full speed&mdash;they were dead opposite
the lava patch. Biff cut the motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be somewhere about here,&rdquo; Biff said.
&ldquo;You shin up the mainmast. I&rsquo;m going to put the yawl
in a tight circle, starting right here, then I&rsquo;ll increase
the circle every time we make one full turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Li was climbing the mast to a height of about
fifteen feet, Biff ducked down into the cabin for a
marking buoy. This he tossed overside. Its metal
weight plunged to the bottom and held. The red-and-white
buoy would be the hub of the circle he would
put the yawl into. Biff started the engine again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set, Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start the merry-go-round,&rdquo; Li called back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>The <i>Easy Action</i> made a tight circle. Biff edged the
tiller away from him, and the second circle was of a
greater circumference. Biff eased off on the tiller
again. The yawl described a larger circle. If the
sunken hulk was in that area, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any
chance of missing it. The water was clear, the sea
calm.</p>
<p>Round and round they went. The bobbing red-and-white
marking buoy became a mere speck. Biff could
barely make it out with his naked eye.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed; then another. The sun was
slanting downward, not more than two hours from
its nightly dip into the Pacific.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it, Biff! Hold it!&rdquo; came the excited shout
from Li.</p>
<p>Biff threw the engine into reverse. He leaped forward
and let down the anchor. He turned and looked
up at Li, who, shading his eyes, was peering intently
into the water off the yawl&rsquo;s portside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spotted it, Biff. I&rsquo;m sure of it. If I haven&rsquo;t,
well&mdash;you come up and take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li slid down the mast and Biff shinned up. He
looked at the spot Li had pointed out. For a time, his
eyes were unable to discover any difference as he
squinted, looking down into the water. After several
minutes, he did make out a formation differing from
anything around it. It was a dark object. Biff could
think only of a whale, or some other large sea animal,
lying on the ocean&rsquo;s floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Li. There&rsquo;s something down there.&rdquo;
He slid down the mast. &ldquo;But how are we going to find
out just what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li grinned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy, Biff. You have on board
your ship <i>Easy Action</i>, Captain Brewster, none other
than the world&rsquo;s record-holding free skin diver, Likake
Mahenili.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to dive down there?&rdquo; Biff said, awe
in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not going to until we sound for the
depth here. What&rsquo;s the deepest dive you&rsquo;ve ever made,
Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-five, maybe fifty feet if I stretch it a little,&rdquo;
Li replied.</p>
<p>Biff got out the sounding line. This was a thin,
strong rope. It had a heavy sinker on the end. At intervals
of one foot, it had a metal weight to mark off
the depth. Biff tossed it overboard. The line seemed
to run out endlessly. Biff was afraid the ocean&rsquo;s depth
here was going to turn out to be too great for Li to
try a dive. Then he felt the thud of the heavy sinker
touching bottom. He drew the rope tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go. Let&rsquo;s both count the markers as we
pull it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff worked slowly, carefully. They couldn&rsquo;t risk
any mistakes in their count.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>When the sinker broke the surface, Biff looked at
Li. &ldquo;How many markers did you count?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-three. Does that check with your count?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the nose, Li, on the nose. I make it forty-three
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I can make that easy. But, hey, how am I
going to know if it&rsquo;s the right boat? What was the
name of Mr. Huntington&rsquo;s sloop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Sea Islander</i>, Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Can you work the boat over a bit? I&rsquo;d like
to be right over her when I make my dive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Li. Take up the anchor. Just enough to
get it off the bottom. Then let go the second I call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff went back to the cockpit. He pushed the engine&rsquo;s
starting button. He had to go forward about
ten feet and edge the yawl to the port about fifteen.
He shoved the tiller away, putting the boat to the
port, and went forward about twenty feet. Then he
pulled the tiller to him, put the yawl in reverse, and
came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;er go,&rdquo; he called out. He felt the anchor
grab. It must be almost alongside the sunken object.</p>
<p>Li came back to the cockpit, darted into the cabin,
and came out with a small anchor. It was a spare for
the dinghy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want that thing for?&rdquo; Biff demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;A weight. I&rsquo;m going down with it. It will pull me
down a lot faster than I could swim. And forty-three
feet is a lot of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it is. You all ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li nodded his head. He had changed into brief,
skin-tight swim trunks. He walked over to the starboard
side of the yawl. He took some wooden
matches and hurled them into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to find out if there&rsquo;s much flow here. If
there&rsquo;s any current. I have to judge my dive by the
current.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched the matches. They seemed to bob
up and down in the same place. Li had tossed them
about ten feet from the yawl. As they watched, they
saw the distance between yawl and matches closing.
It was closing, all right, but slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know all I have to, Biff. Very slight current.
Nothing to worry about; nothing I have to figure on
particularly. Here I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Biff could even call &ldquo;good luck,&rdquo; Li, the
small anchor held in front of him, plunged into the
water.</p>
<p>The wait for Li to surface began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />Exploring the Depths</h2>
<p>When Likake disappeared beneath the surface, Biff
glanced quickly at his watch. He tried to remember
the record for a person&rsquo;s holding his breath while under
water. Was it three minutes? Four? He remembered
reading of some Polynesian divers in Bali who
had remained submerged for six minutes.</p>
<p>How long could Li hold his breath? Biff looked
at his watch again. Already the sweep hand had
passed the two-minute mark.</p>
<p>Biff began to worry. The seconds ticked by slowly,
as if held back by a magnet. The three-minute mark
was approaching. Surely Li couldn&rsquo;t hold out much
longer. Biff&rsquo;s eyes kept shifting from the water to the
sweep hand of his watch. Three minutes! Still no
sign of Li. Biff made up his mind. He was going in
after Li. He slipped off his watch and peeled off his
shirt. Just as he was preparing to dive, Li&rsquo;s head broke
the surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="829" />
<p class="caption"><i>How long could Li hold his breath?</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>For several moments, the Hawaiian boy lay in the
water, head back, body floating. He needed time to
recover. Biff could see his chest heaving up and down
beneath the two inches of water covering it. Finally,
Li turned his head. He looked up at Biff and smiled.
He turned over, and with one powerful stroke, propelled
himself to the side of the yawl.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s eager hands helped heave Li overside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all right? You were sure down long enough!&rdquo;
Biff said.</p>
<p>Li nodded his head, his chest still moved in and out
as he took deep breaths, exhaling them slowly. Biff
was dying to find out what, if anything, Li had
learned on his dive, but he didn&rsquo;t want to press his
friend.</p>
<p>Li let out a &ldquo;H-a-a-a-a-a. Boy! Guess that&rsquo;s the
deepest I&rsquo;ve ever dived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff couldn&rsquo;t stand the suspense any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you find? Was it a sloop? Was it
the <i>Sea Islander</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes to both questions, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoopee! Eeeowie! We&rsquo;ve found it! We&rsquo;ve
found it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Biff grabbed Li by the shoulders and whirled him
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure, Li? You&rsquo;re positive it&rsquo;s the <i>Sea Islander</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Biff. There was a life preserver still attached
to the side of the sloop&rsquo;s cabin. I could make
out the letters spelling the boat&rsquo;s name. And those letters
sure did spell out <i>Sea Islander</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What condition&rsquo;s she in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t tell much. She&rsquo;s heeled over on
her starboard side, I think. Not all the way. Her mast
is broken off, as far as I could tell. Some of her ropes
are still attached. I brushed against them both going
down and coming back up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li had stretched out on the deck of the <i>Easy Action</i>.
Strength was flowing back into his body. Staying
submerged as long as he had takes a lot out of a
person physically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Li. I think we&rsquo;d better get back to our original
anchorage. Your dad and mine must be back there
by now. If they&rsquo;re not, well, we&rsquo;ll have to forget
about the <i>Sea Islander</i> and really look for them. We
may have to go for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go, though, Biff, I&rsquo;d like to go back
down to the <i>Sea Islander</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again? What in the world for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not all the way. But don&rsquo;t you think it would be
a good idea if we could attach a marker to one of the
loose lines? Then we&rsquo;d be able to spot this location
easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, Li. How near the surface do those
loose lines come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d guess twenty, maybe twenty-five feet.
Won&rsquo;t be much of a dive this time. Not after going
down over forty feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Li. You lie there and rest. I&rsquo;ll rig a marking
buoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff went below and took out another buoy from
the yawl&rsquo;s captain&rsquo;s chest. This was an all-white one.
He attached a short length of nylon rope to the buoy,
and a metal clip to the other end of the rope.</p>
<p>Returning to the deck, he showed it to Li. &ldquo;How
will this do? I figure you can tie a fast knot in one of
those loose lines, then just snap this metal fastener below
the knot. Then it won&rsquo;t slip off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell, Biff. I&rsquo;ve got my breath back now. This
won&rsquo;t take a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li took the buoy. A frown came over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, with this buoy, it&rsquo;s going to make it tougher
to get down. The other time, remember, I had the
help of a weight pulling me down&mdash;the dinghy&rsquo;s
emergency anchor. Now I&rsquo;ve got this buoy, which
will be working against me. I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix that.&rdquo; Biff went astern. He pulled in the
dinghy which was tied to the stem of the yawl,
hopped in, and cut its anchor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Li. That cleans us out of dinghy
anchors. They go fast on a day like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marked down. Special sale.&rdquo; Li grinned in reply.
He stepped to the side of the yawl. Holding buoy and
anchor in front of him, once more the Hawaiian boy
jumped feet first into the blue water.</p>
<p>Biff looked at his watch again, but he wasn&rsquo;t worried
this time. Li was only going down twenty feet.
Feeling quite happy over finding the <i>Sea Islander</i>,
Biff whistled a popular tune. He looked up at Mauna
Loa, wondering where his father might be at the moment.
He glanced down at his watch. He couldn&rsquo;t believe
his eyes. Unless he had misread the time of Li&rsquo;s
submersion, three minutes had already passed.</p>
<p>Biff swiftly went into action. Li shouldn&rsquo;t have
taken more than two minutes&mdash;not that long&mdash;for
this dive. Biff&rsquo;s body split the water. He pulled himself
downward. The water pressure at the depth of
fifteen feet was already exerting abnormal pressure
on his chest. Still he pulled himself downward. He
had to. <i>I&rsquo;ve got to find Li</i>, he told himself.</p>
<p>At twenty feet beneath the surface, with his lungs
screaming for air, Biff&rsquo;s hands touched Li&rsquo;s head. The
Hawaiian boy was fighting frantically to free one leg
from a rope entwined around it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Biff used Li&rsquo;s body to pull himself the four feet
farther downward to reach the rope. He tore at it,
felt it give, and Li&rsquo;s leg was free. Biff placed his
hands on Li&rsquo;s body and gave it a powerful thrust upward.
Then, barely able to hold his breath any longer,
he spread his hands, palms downward, pushed with all
his might and shot toward the surface.</p>
<p>When Biff broke the surface, gasping for breath,
he looked for his friend. There was Li, only a few feet
away. But from the position of his head, lolling to
one side in the water, Biff knew the boy was unconscious.
Tired as he was, his own lungs aching
from the recent strain put upon them, Biff swam to
Li&rsquo;s side. At first, all he did was support Li&rsquo;s head,
keeping his nose and mouth from going under water.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Biff kicked his way to the
side of the yawl. He felt the need of support, too.
With one hand holding on to the <i>Easy Action</i> amidship,
he held onto Li with the other. Biff had no way
of knowing as yet whether Li had swallowed so much
water that his lungs were filled. He kept the word
&ldquo;drowned&rdquo; out of his mind.</p>
<p>When he had regained his strength, Biff let go of
the yawl. Treading water, he took Li&rsquo;s head in both
hands and drew it right up to his own face. He placed
his cheek against Li&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>Thank heavens! He could feel Li&rsquo;s breath on his
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Biff pulled himself and Li back to the side of the
<i>Easy Action</i>. He placed Li directly against the side of
the yawl. He released him and at the same instant,
pulled himself quickly onto the deck. Then, belly
down, he leaned over and was just able to grasp Li
under the arms. With a powerful tug, he pulled the
still unconscious boy onto the deck.</p>
<p>His first action was to turn him over and administer
first aid. He raised and lowered Li&rsquo;s body to expel any
water that might still be in his lungs. Then he placed
Li on his side, his face turned toward the deck. He
watched Li&rsquo;s troubled breathing become easier.</p>
<p>Biff sank back with a sigh of relief. His friend was
going to be all right. A tremendous weariness swept
over Biff. He hadn&rsquo;t known how near to the point of
exhaustion he had brought himself. For the next half
hour, both boys lay on the deck regaining their
strength.</p>
<p>The slanting rays of the setting sun were casting
long shadows on the slope of the Mauna Loa. Biff sat
up. He didn&rsquo;t know at first what had caught his attention.
He stared at the side of the volcano. He saw it
again. A quick flash, a bright reflection. It disappeared.
Biff kept his eyes trained on the spot. There it was
again. He turned. The sun was low on the horizon,
but still bright. He realized that the <i>Easy Action</i> was
directly between the setting sun and the flash of reflected
light he had spotted.</p>
<p>What could it be? Was it his imagination?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Biff felt Li stir beside him. The Hawaiian boy
opened his eyes. A feeble smile touched his lips. He
tried to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Li. Rest a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Biff looked again at the spot on the Mauna Loa
where he had seen the flash. It came again, then disappeared.</p>
<p>Biff heard Li&rsquo;s faltering voice behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved my life, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li was sitting up now. Biff felt embarrassed. What
was there to say? He turned to his friend, and the
smiles they exchanged expressed more than any words
could possibly do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened, anyway, Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my own fault, Biff. I guess I panicked. I got
down easily. Found a loose rope. But I had trouble
staying submerged while I tried to tie a knot. So I
made a quick slip knot and hooked it over my leg to
hold me steady while I tied the knot to fasten the
clasp to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff frowned. &ldquo;You mean you sort of anchored
yourself to the <i>Sea Islander</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you could call it that. Anyway, it took
longer than I figured. Once I had hooked the buoy on
the rope, I tried to free my leg from the slip knot.
My body pulling on the knot had tightened it. The
wet rope made the knot even harder to undo. That&rsquo;s
when I panicked, I guess. The more I worked on the
knot, the tighter it seemed to get. Then I sort of
blacked out. I don&rsquo;t even remember you&rsquo;re coming
down to rescue me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness I got there in time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li put his hands over his face. His shoulders shook.
Biff realized the boy was crying. He said nothing.
Better to let Li get the shock out of his system. He
continued to watch his friend carefully. Li had come
close to death.</p>
<p>Li, after a few moments, removed his hands and
grinned. &ldquo;Sorry, Biff, I guess I&rsquo;m acting like a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. After what you just went through, well&mdash;Say,
I want you to see if you can see what I just
saw&mdash;if you can follow all that &lsquo;see&rsquo; and &lsquo;saw.&rsquo;&rdquo; Biff
wanted to change the subject, stop Li from thinking
about his narrow escape. He also wanted to check
the flash he had just seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look over there, Li. About two thousand feet up
the slope of Mauna Loa.&rdquo; He pointed with his arm.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d swear I&rsquo;ve just been seeing light reflected. Seems
like a mirror pointed into the sun&mdash;you know, the
way kids sometimes signal to one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li raised his eyes. Both boys saw the reflection come
at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it, Biff. There it is. Now it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it could be, Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like you said, maybe a mirror or&mdash;or glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Glasses. Someone&rsquo;s got binoculars trained
on us. And we&rsquo;re right in the path of the setting sun.
Someone&rsquo;s watching us through binoculars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s probably my dad and
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, I sure hope so.&rdquo; But even as Biff spoke the
words, another idea came into his head. &ldquo;Or, Li, it
could be Perez Soto.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />Reunion</h2>
<p>It was Perez Soto.</p>
<p>The swarthy adventurer was standing on a lava
ledge not far from the spot where Biff and Li had
sighted the sunken hulk of the <i>Sea Islander</i> earlier in
the day.</p>
<p>Through his powerful binoculars, he had watched
every movement the boys had made. He had seen Li&rsquo;s
first and second dives. His glasses were of such powerful
magnification he could even see the exultant expressions
on the boys&rsquo; faces. He knew they had made
an important discovery, and he was certain what the
discovery was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>A crafty smile came over his heavy features as a
plan formed in his scheming mind. He would go back
to his hideout and get his henchman, Madeira. Then,
quickly to his power boat, the <i>Black Falcon</i>, and head
for the dot on the ocean where he had seen the boys.</p>
<p>He had little thought for Dr. Weber. The thing to
do now, and do it fast, was to get out to the sunken
<i>Sea Islander</i> and stake his salvage claim. In the case
of a lost boat, or a sunken one, it was &ldquo;first come, first
served.&rdquo; The important thing, though, was not only
to take the claim, but remain in possession of it.</p>
<p>With his glasses still on the <i>Easy Action</i>, he saw one
of the boys raising the anchor. He saw the yawl set a
course toward Ka Lae, leaving the sunken sloop abandoned.</p>
<p>Too bad about Dr. Weber. Maybe someone would
find him, maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t. Perez Soto didn&rsquo;t
care. All he wanted to do now was to establish his
salvage rights, and do so in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>He stepped back from the ledge and started walking
rapidly toward his hideout.</p>
<p class="tb">Thomas Brewster and Hanale Mahenili watched
with torn emotions as Perez Soto threatened and tormented
Dr. Weber. Both men wanted to act. Both
knew, however, that to do so would not only endanger
the doctor&rsquo;s life, but would also jeopardize their
chances of rescuing the old man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The morning passed. Perez Soto continued his
threats. But the old doctor held firm. He refused to
answer any of his captor&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>Madeira, Perez Soto&rsquo;s henchman, kept his snub-nosed
revolver steadily pointed at the doctor. Brewster
and Mahenili didn&rsquo;t dare try to jump the kidnapers.</p>
<p>About noontime, Perez Soto took the gun from
Madeira. Madeira prepared some food by lighting a
small fire and heating up some stew he took from a
can. The smell of the steaming stew rising to the cliff
where Brewster and Mahenili were hiding, sent sharp
pangs of hunger rumbling through their stomachs.</p>
<p>Shortly after Perez Soto and Madeira had eaten,
Perez Soto, as if having an afterthought, poked a
spoonful of food at the doctor&rsquo;s mouth. The doctor
turned his head away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that, Hank,&rdquo; Brewster whispered. &ldquo;I think
the doctor wants to die. He&rsquo;s refusing food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he feels that death is preferable to any
more of Perez Soto&rsquo;s threats and demands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About two o&rsquo;clock, Perez Soto entered the cave
which he was using for a hideout and emerged minutes
later with a pair of binoculars slung over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard the old man well,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back
before sunset.&rdquo; He strode off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Brewster whispered to Mahenili. &ldquo;I think our chance
will come now. We&rsquo;ll let Perez Soto get well on his
way, then we&rsquo;ll find a way of jumping the guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time came more quickly than either man could
have hoped for. Madeira, his stomach filled with stew,
could be seen to yawn. They saw him shake his head
to ward off sleep. Apparently feeling that there was
little threat of Dr. Weber&rsquo;s attempting to escape, the
guard checked the ropes binding the doctor&rsquo;s hands
and feet. He sat down nearby, propping his back
against a large boulder, the gun in his hands.</p>
<p>Brewster and Mahenili watched every move. They
saw the guard&rsquo;s head nod forward. They saw him
bring it up with a jerk and shake his head from side to
side in an effort to remain awake. They saw the process
repeated. For the third time, the guard&rsquo;s head
dropped forward. This time, it stayed there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our chance,&rdquo; Brewster said to his friend.</p>
<p>Mahenili nodded in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Brewster measured the distance between himself and
the sleeping guard. The drop from the ledge to the
ground in front of the cave was a good fifteen feet.
From where he would land, Brewster would still have
to cross a clearing of ten feet before he could reach the
guard. The noise of his landing would certainly arouse
the guard. Before Brewster could cross the opening to
close with him, the guard would have time to raise his
pistol and fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>A plan shaped up in Thomas Brewster&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank, here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll have to do it. You crawl
back. Make your way to the rear of the guard if it&rsquo;s
possible. Creep up as near to him as you can. Keep me
in sight. When you see me leap from this ledge, you
spring forward. Try to take him from the rear. Hurl a
rock at him, anything. Just try to give me enough time
to leap across that clearing and grapple with the guard
before he can fire. Once I get my hands on him, I can
handle him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you can&rsquo;t see me, Tom, how will you know
when to leap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now two-twenty-two. I&rsquo;ll make my move at
exactly two-thirty. I&rsquo;ll just have to trust that you&rsquo;ve
been able to get behind the guard. Go along now, and
good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brewster kept shifting his glance from the sleeping
guard to the minute hand on his watch. It seemed that
the large hand would never reach the half-hour mark.
But it did.</p>
<p>At exactly two-thirty, Brewster stood up. He
jumped. He went to his knees and rolled when he hit
the ground, fifteen feet beneath him. It was a fall he
had learned in his army training, one designed to prevent
a broken ankle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>He leaped quickly to his feet. The guard, awakened,
stood up. He was still groggy from sleep and
confused. He could hear sounds from behind him, and
here right in front of him, a large man was charging
him.</p>
<p>Brewster hit Madeira with a jolting right cross before
the guard could think straight. He hit the ground
with a thud. Brewster was on top of him like a hungry
tiger making a kill. From the rear, Mahenili sprang into
the arena, spotted the pistol still in the guard&rsquo;s outstretched
hand, and kicked it away.</p>
<p>The fight was over. It had been an easy victory.</p>
<p>In minutes, Dr. Weber was freed, and his bonds
were used to truss up the guard. As an extra precaution,
Brewster used his handkerchief to gag the guard.
He didn&rsquo;t want him calling for help. No telling how
near Perez Soto might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Weber, my friend.&rdquo; Brewster leaned over to
help the doctor to his feet. &ldquo;How are you? Are you
injured in any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly my dignity,&rdquo; the doctor grunted gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you able to walk? We must get away from
here before Perez Soto returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrumph!&rdquo; the good doctor hurrumphed indignantly.
&ldquo;You youngsters seem to think I&rsquo;m an old
dotard, dying on my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster had to smile at being called a youngster.
But he was a good thirty years younger than Dr.
Weber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can walk!&rdquo; The doctor took two steps,
and would have fallen if Biff&rsquo;s father hadn&rsquo;t caught
him.</p>
<p>Dr. Weber glared up at his friend. &ldquo;Release me. All
I need is for the circulation to be restored to my legs.
I&rsquo;ve been tied up most of the time.&rdquo; The doctor was
stubborn. He gingerly raised one leg, then the other.
He flapped his arms against his sides. He cautiously
took another step, glancing out of the side of his eye
to see if Tom Brewster was prepared to help him.</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s vitality was amazing. Brewster got
him some water. He forced him to take several mouthfuls
of the stew, now cold, but energy giving nonetheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, now,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;You lead the
way. I&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brewster started off on a path leading down to the
coast. Before doing so, he signaled to Mr. Mahenili to
stay close behind the doctor, ready to catch him if he
should fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Their progress downward was slow. Brewster
halted every hundred yards, sometimes more often
where the descent was difficult, to allow the doctor to
regain his strength. Brewster knew Dr. Weber must be
going along on sheer nervous energy. His frail body
just wasn&rsquo;t young enough to take such punishment.
But Biff&rsquo;s father knew also that it is amazing to just
what great limits the human body can go when forced
to do so.</p>
<p>It was dusk when the three men stumbled onto the
beach opposite the <i>Easy Action</i>&rsquo;s first anchorage.
Thomas Brewster looked out over the ocean, and his
heart leaped with joy. He saw the yawl coming into
its anchorage, Li in the bow, ready to drop the anchor,
and Biff at the tiller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Biff! Hi, Li!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />Dawn Attack</h2>
<p>Shouts of joy rippled across the water from Biff and
Li to their fathers. The boys hopped into the dinghy
and sent it fairly flying over the waves to shore.</p>
<p>The first thing to do was to get Dr. Weber on the
boat. The old man&rsquo;s stout, fierce spirit seemed to leave
him once he reached the anchorage. He had exhausted
his reserve strength. He was near the end of his remarkable
endurance.</p>
<p>The others were ferried to the <i>Easy Action</i>. Dr.
Weber was bedded down. Hot soup was prepared for
the aged scientist, and shortly he was sleeping like a
baby, a quite wrinkled baby, true, but his sleep was as
sound and peaceful as that of a one-year-old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Biff quickly filled his father in on what had happened.
He saved until the last the discovery of the
<i>Sea Islander</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I think maybe Perez Soto has spotted her,
too,&rdquo; Biff had to add in conclusion. &ldquo;I think he must
have spotted us when Li was diving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster turned to Mr. Mahenili. &ldquo;That
must have been why Perez Soto went away, giving us
the chance to rescue Dr. Weber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was,&rdquo; the Hawaiian answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what we&rsquo;ve got to do is get back to the <i>Sea
Islander</i> before Perez Soto does. We&rsquo;ve got to hook on
to the sunken boat somehow. Then we&rsquo;ve got to get
into her cabin and locate that metal box with the
cesium sample and the map showing where the field is
located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brewster paused. He had to think this thing through
clearly now. There could be no mistakes, no more
risks. They would have to get a professional diver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank, where is the nearest town to here&mdash;a place
where you can hire a professional diver? Someone
with an aqualung?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine Hilo would be the nearest place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is that from where we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d say roughly seventy-five miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way of getting there, aside from walking?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Tom. I would have to walk inland until I
reached the Wamalahoa Highway&mdash;that&rsquo;s the road
which circles the island. I know I could rent a car or
taxi at Honupo Landing. Not much more than an
hour&rsquo;s drive from there into Hilo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. What do you say to this? We&rsquo;ll put you
ashore right now. You get to Hilo. Hire a skin diver
and get back here as early tomorrow morning as you
can. We&rsquo;ve got to get back to the <i>Sea Islander</i> right
away. How far up the coast is she, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour. Maybe a little more. That&rsquo;s pushing the
yawl at full speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Biff, you row Mr. Mahenili ashore. Li
and I will make ready. Get back fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir.&rdquo; Biff grinned at his father. It was
good to have someone else make the decisions for a
change. And when Biff&rsquo;s father went into action, he did
so with a snap and precision that commanded respect.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take Biff long to set Mr. Mahenili ashore.
The dinghy was quickly secured once the boy returned,
and the <i>Easy Action</i> headed up coast at full
throttle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we can find the place in the dark, Biff?&rdquo; his
father asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take a bit of doing, Dad. But we set a marking
buoy over the <i>Sea Islander</i>, attached to one of her
halyards. Good thing we did, too. We&rsquo;d never be able
to locate a boat on the bottom at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>It took more time than they had calculated to locate
the marking buoy. They had to cruise the area
for more than an hour before a shout from Li told
them they had found it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the problem is,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said, &ldquo;how
are we going to hook our anchor into the sunken ship?
Once we do that, there can be no doubt as to our
salvage rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this, Dad?&rdquo; Biff suggested. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop
the hook until we can feel her just touch bottom.
Then we can run back and forth over the <i>Sea
Islander</i> until we feel the anchor&rsquo;s points sink into her
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Excellent suggestion.&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father acted at
once. He brought the <i>Easy Action</i> about and aimed
her bow directly at the marking buoy. They felt the
anchor drag as it struck the submerged sloop. But on
their first pass the hook didn&rsquo;t catch. Mr. Brewster reversed
his course. This time the hook sunk into the side
of the sunken <i>Sea Islander</i> and held. Mr. Brewster
revved up the engine, and the <i>Easy Action</i> tugged at
her sunken sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to set the anchor in her side but good,&rdquo;
Mr. Brewster said. He cut the engine. &ldquo;Try the winch,
Biff. See if you can raise the anchor. I want to make
sure we&rsquo;re really caught onto her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff did so. He put all his strength into trying to
turn the winch. The anchor was set. The <i>Easy Action</i>
and the <i>Sea Islander</i> were joined by a stout, thick
hawser.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>It was late. Everyone, feeling happy about their
success, was ready to turn in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired, Li?&rdquo; Biff asked. His answer was a quick nod
of his friend&rsquo;s head as Li headed below for the comfort
of his berth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep on deck again tonight, Dad.
Perez Soto&rsquo;s boat is in these waters. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll
try anything tonight, but you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Biff. I agree. We can&rsquo;t take any chances
with success so near at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff rolled himself up in a sleeping bag and was
asleep the minute he finished zipping it up. Early in the
morning, an hour or more before sunrise, he was
wide awake. He lay still, staring up at the sky. Stars
covered it like a million white dots on a field of navy
blue. A quarter moon, looking like an orange section,
still hung in the sky.</p>
<p>A soft splash attracted Biff&rsquo;s attention. He rose on
one elbow and looked in the direction of the noise. It
came again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be a fish jumping,&rdquo; he told himself. Adjusting
his eyes to the night, Biff peered more keenly toward
the sound. He raised his glance, and his heart
started thudding. Lying at anchor, not more than a
quarter of a mile away, was the outline of a power
boat. Biff was sure it was the same one which had tried
to swamp the <i>Easy Action</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Biff crept noiselessly to the stem of the yawl. He
went below. Reaching his father&rsquo;s berth, he shook
him gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, Dad,&rdquo; he whispered softly. &ldquo;Wake up. I think
someone&rsquo;s trying to board the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster was out of his berth in an instant.
Li, hearing the noise, leaped out of his bunk, too.</p>
<p>Silently the three crept back to the cockpit. They
raised their heads over the gunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Dad. Listen carefully. I heard a noise;
sounded like a fish jumping. Right over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three strained their ears. They heard the sound
again. Then they saw what was causing it. A man was
swimming toward the <i>Easy Action</i>. They could make
out his head moving slowly, but steadily along, coming
toward the yawl.</p>
<p>When the swimmer was some twenty feet from the
<i>Easy Action</i>, the pale light of the moon was reflected
by an object the swimmer was holding in his mouth.
In the brief instant of the gleam, the object became
clear to them all. It was a long knife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>

<br />A Human Fish</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think he is up to, Biff?&rdquo; Li asked in a
whisper.</p>
<p>The swimmer was nearing the yawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that knife in his mouth, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s
much doubt about it. Do you, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends on what you&rsquo;re thinking, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think this is Perez Soto&rsquo;s last, desperate effort
to establish his salvage rights to the <i>Sea Islander</i>.
I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s his boat over there, just off our starboard
bow. See it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The power cruiser, the <i>Black Falcon</i>, was sharply
silhouetted now in the lightening dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perez Soto&rsquo;s sent that swimmer over to cut our anchor
rope,&rdquo; Biff continued. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you agree,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would he want to do that?&rdquo; Li asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if his man could cut our line, and we were
still asleep, we&rsquo;d drift. Even in the slight current that
runs in these waters, we&rsquo;d drift half a mile or more in a
very short time. Once we were out of the way, he
could easily sink his own line onto the <i>Sea Islander</i> and
establish his rights of salvage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swimmer was now only ten feet from the yawl.
Biff reached down and pulled out a boathook, a long
pole with a hook on one end, used to grab a mooring
when coming into an anchorage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hook me a human fish,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Biff raised the boathook. He rested its hooked end
on the gunnel. The swimmer was now within hooking
distance. Biff shot the boathook out. It grazed the
swimmer&rsquo;s head. Feeling it, the swimmer dived. Biff
prodded forward with the boathook. He felt it catch.
The pole bent just like a fishing pole as the swimmer
tried to get away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got him, Dad. Got him!&rdquo; Biff shouted happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure have, Biff. You got him right by the seat
of his swimming trunks. Here, let me give you a
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Biff pulled the pole, with his human catch on the
other end, partly into the boat. He and his father put
their weight onto the in-boat end. The pole became a
lever, lifting their catch out of the water.</p>
<p>A funnier catch Biff, his father, and Li had never
seen. It was Li who started laughing first.</p>
<p>In the rapidly increasing daylight, they could see
Perez Soto&rsquo;s man on the end of the pole. He was waving
his arms, kicking his legs frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like a crab,&rdquo; Li chortled.</p>
<p>He did. The man, caught by the seat of his swim
pants on the hook, was unable to reach back to free
himself. He was suspended three feet above the water,
still kicking and squirming furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do with him, Dad? Throw him back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve used many a weapon to defend myself in the
past, but a boathook ... this is the laughing end.&rdquo;
Both boys made an &ldquo;ouch&rdquo; face at the bad pun. Mr.
Brewster turned to Li. &ldquo;Get a flashlight, Li. I want to
make sure who this human shark is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li darted into the cabin and darted right back. He
didn&rsquo;t want to miss a thing.</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster shone the flashlight on the
hooked, would-be knife wielder&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; Brewster said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the man
who was guarding Dr. Weber. I heard Perez Soto call
him Madeira.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Madeira, in his frantic struggling, had dropped the
knife from his mouth. He was no longer any threat to
the <i>Easy Action</i> and her crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I might as well drop him back in the water,
hadn&rsquo;t I, Dad?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, son. Let him go. In the water he can free
himself. Then you just watch him head back for Perez
Soto and the <i>Black Falcon</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not serious, Dad!&rdquo; Biff exclaimed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
dangerous to let them get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Biff didn&rsquo;t have to drop Madeira back into the
water. There came a ripping sound. Madeira&rsquo;s hooked
swim trunks split. The water prowler hit the water
with a belly whopper. Pantless, he turned and swam
away.</p>
<p>Biff, Li, and Mr. Brewster howled with laughter.
When the laughter died away, Mr. Brewster said, &ldquo;To
answer your question, Biff. They&rsquo;re too dangerous to
keep aboard. We&rsquo;ll have to leave them to the authorities.
They&rsquo;ll track them down, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had grown much lighter. It was easy to follow the
swimmer&rsquo;s progress back to the <i>Black Falcon</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go without his breakfast when he gets back,&rdquo;
Tom Brewster said. &ldquo;Perez Soto will be furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of breakfast&mdash;&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Li cut in.</p>
<p>They went below. All hungry. All happy, feeling
that they were nearing the climax of their Hawaiian
sea hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like easy sailing from here on in, Dad,&rdquo; Biff
said, munching a piece of toast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t get your hopes up too high, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have to locate that metal box. We have no
assurance that it&rsquo;s still in the <i>Sea Islander&rsquo;s</i> cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A frown of disappointment came over Biff&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying it isn&rsquo;t there, understand,&rdquo; his father
went on. &ldquo;But remember, the <i>Sea Islander</i> has been on
the bottom for several weeks. The box could have
been tossed around in the storm that sank the boat. It
might have floated out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remainder of their breakfast was eaten in a concerned
silence.</p>
<p>Biff and Li were cleaning up the galley. Thomas
Brewster was talking to Dr. Weber. The doctor had
had a good night&rsquo;s sleep and said he was feeling fine.
He chortled over the human fish incident.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s sharp ears caught the sound first. From a distance
came a low, steady buzzing. Biff ran on deck.
From just off Ka Lae, he spotted a low flying plane. It
was coming directly at the <i>Easy Action</i>. In moments,
Biff was able to distinguish its lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, Dad!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a seaplane coming
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li was on deck first, followed by Thomas Brewster
and Dr. Weber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>They watched the plane. It came in low over the
yawl, dipped its wings in salute, then described a long
circle to head into the wind. It settled ducklike on the
water and taxied toward the <i>Easy Action</i>.</p>
<p>One man stood up in the open cockpit by the pilot.
He was waving his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dad! It&rsquo;s my father!&rdquo; Li shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it surely is. Li, when your father goes into
action, he moves fast. I never thought he&rsquo;d come back
in a plane. I thought he&rsquo;d charter another boat,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster said.</p>
<p>The seaplane taxied to within ten feet of the <i>Easy
Action</i>, its twin propellers barely turning, just fast
enough to give the plane headway. Henry Mahenili
stood up and tossed a rope toward the yawl. It fell
short. He pulled it in, and again the rope snaked out
toward the yawl. This time Biff caught it. He tugged
on the rope, and the plane closed the gap of water
separating it from the yawl. Its nose bumped gently
against <i>Easy Action</i>&rsquo;s starboard side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us about five feet of play, young man,&rdquo; the
pilot called out. Even in this calm sea, he didn&rsquo;t want
to take any chances on the nose of his plane being
punched in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can do better than that,&rdquo; Biff called, knowing the
reason for the pilot&rsquo;s concern. He went below and
brought out extra boat snubbers, made of foam rubber.
He hooked them over the gunnel, forming a soft protecting
barrier between the side of the yawl and the
nose of the plane. Then he pulled the plane within two
feet of the yawl, making it easy for the plane&rsquo;s passengers
to hop from plane to boat.</p>
<p>Hank Mahenili was first aboard. He was followed
by a muscularly built Hawaiian. The pilot came last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Kamuela Mamola, the skin diver I hired,&rdquo;
Hank said, introducing the muscular young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just call me Sammy&mdash;that&rsquo;s what my Hawaiian
name means. You got a job for me?&rdquo; the young man
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure have, Sammy,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said. &ldquo;Right
downstairs.&rdquo; He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That line over the port side,&rdquo; Biff said, indicating
the line. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our anchor rope. It&rsquo;s caught in the
sunken sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; the diver said. &ldquo;Then there shouldn&rsquo;t be
any trouble at all.&rdquo; He hopped back aboard the plane,
dug around its cabin for a few minutes, then reappeared
with his skin diving equipment. This consisted
of a glass face mask, and a small oxygen tank connected
to his aqualung.</p>
<p>Coming back on the <i>Easy Action</i>, he donned his
equipment, touched his hand to his forehead in salute,
and slipped overboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Biff leaned over the gunnel. He saw the diver pulling
himself downward, using the anchor rope to guide
him. It was the same as climbing a rope hand over
hand, only in reverse.</p>
<p>Bubbles from the aqualung kept breaking the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never thought of this, Hank,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;No one
told Sammy what to look for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, they did, Tom. Me. I did. On the way
over. I couldn&rsquo;t give him much of a description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t have much to go on. Just some kind
of metal box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told him. I imagine it&rsquo;s similar to the
small locker-box you keep semi-valuable papers in at
home. That&rsquo;s what I told him, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to know soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Air bubbles dotted the surface near the port side of
the <i>Easy Action</i>. Five minutes went by. Ten. At fifteen
minutes, worry began to appear on the faces of
those on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think anything could have happened to the diver?&rdquo;
Tom Brewster asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dad. Not as long as those bubbles keep coming
up regularly. He&rsquo;s all right. If those bubbles stop,
we worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After twenty minutes, Biff saw the anchor rope
tighten, as if someone had pulled it from the other end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s coming up,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>Everyone leaned over the portside of the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Moments later, Sammy&rsquo;s wet head broke the surface.
He wrenched the glass face mask from his head.</p>
<p>Disappointment swept over the boat. The diver
was empty-handed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />Check-Out</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so worried,&rdquo; Sammy Mamola said. The
skin diver looked up at the disappointed faces. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t expect to bring up that box on my first dive.
Give me a little more time. I do think I may have
located it, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Expressions of hope replaced the sad faces aboard
the <i>Easy Action</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need another tool,&rdquo; Sammy said. &ldquo;A short bar,
two or three feet long. If what I think is the box, it&rsquo;s
jammed, and I can&rsquo;t free it without prizing it. What
have you got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sammy was treading water, one hand resting
lightly on the yawl&rsquo;s gunnel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look in the tool box,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>While he was gone, Sammy told them what he had
found below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boat sure took a beating. Everything in the
cabin is smashed up. She&rsquo;s filled with sand, and other
sea trash. I had to chase some fish out, too. Especially
a small octopus&mdash;didn&rsquo;t want it squirting its ink
around, clouding my vision. I found what I think
may be your box under a mound of sand and broken
sea shells. Couldn&rsquo;t pull it out, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any sign of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Mahenili, no sign of the poor fellow who
went down with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff had returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will this do?&rdquo; He held up a metal bar, about
three-quarters of an inch thick and thirty inches long.
It was used to turn the engine over if its electric
starter didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing.&rdquo; Sammy reached up for it. &ldquo;Well,
here I go again. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have better luck this
time.&rdquo; The diver submerged again.</p>
<p>All had been so interested in the diver&rsquo;s activities
and report that they hadn&rsquo;t noticed the <i>Black Falcon</i>.
It was Li who spotted Perez Soto&rsquo;s boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Dad,&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>The <i>Black Falcon</i> had left its anchorage and moved
over until it was only two hundred feet from the
<i>Easy Action</i>. Perez Soto was watching every action
aboard the yawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say one thing for that man,&rdquo; Tom Brewster said.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t give up until the final chance is gone. If
he sees us bring up that metal box, he&rsquo;ll still try to
get it away from us somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will,&rdquo; Hank Mahenili said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; Hank Mahenili smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>Another fifteen minutes went by. A steady stream
of bubbles broke the surface. The diver was working.
Thomas Brewster kept looking at his watch. Biff and
Li, lying on their stomachs, watched the area dotted
with bubbles. Biff, looking up, noticed Madeira frantically
winding up the anchor winch of the <i>Black
Falcon</i>. Perez Soto was already at the wheel, shouting
at his henchman to hurry up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, look at that,&rdquo; Biff exclaimed. &ldquo;Looks like
Perez Soto has changed his mind. He&rsquo;s in a hurry to
get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was. The anchor of the <i>Black Falcon</i> was
barely out of the water when Perez Soto jammed the
throttle of the cruiser full speed forward, and the
boat leaped away, leaving a high, foaming wake at its
stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder what made him change his mind?&rdquo;
Tom Brewster asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know the answer to that. Look over
there.&rdquo; Hank Mahenili said.</p>
<p>They looked in the direction he was pointing. A
low, gray boat was coming along at a racing clip.
Huge numbers on its bow identified it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Coast Guard cutter,&rdquo; Biff shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff. Now watch. We may see some
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cutter was after the <i>Black Falcon</i>. The cruiser
was fast, but no match for the Coast Guard cutter. She
closed the gap between the boats rapidly.</p>
<p>Perez Soto wasn&rsquo;t giving up, however. He tried
maneuvering, swerving the <i>Black Falcon</i> from one
direction to another on a zigzag course.</p>
<p>The people on the <i>Easy Action</i> heard the boom of
a small cannon. Looking at the cutter, they saw a puff
of smoke from its forward gun. Then they saw a
splash as a shell dropped just in front of the <i>Falcon</i>&rsquo;s
bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t heave to now, the next projectile
will be directed at the ship,&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili said.</p>
<p>But Perez Soto had had enough. He heaved to.
The cutter came alongside, and two Coast Guardsmen,
guns in hand, boarded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine our troubles with Perez Soto are at an
end,&rdquo; Mr. Mahenili said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your doing?&rdquo; Tom Brewster asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Hank nodded his head. &ldquo;Kidnaping. I reported
Perez Soto as having kidnaped Dr. Weber. He&rsquo;ll be
dealt with harshly. One witness against him will be
Tokawto. He&rsquo;s recovering. It was Perez Soto who
gave him that stab wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you really did get around in Hilo, Mr.
Mahenili,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave any loose strings dangling.
Incidentally, did Dr. Weber ever tell you how he
happened to be abducted from his hotel room?&rdquo;
Hank asked Tom Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did. He was talking to me when he felt a
sharp point in his back. That was the call I took in
Indianapolis, Biff. It was Perez Soto. With a sharp
knife at his back and Perez Soto threatening to use
the knife, there was nothing the doctor could do but
obey instructions. They walked out of the porch entrance
and through the garden to a waiting car. Madeira
was the driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Weber smiled at the group. &ldquo;Perhaps I should
have resisted, but&mdash;I knew Perez Soto meant what he
said. I went along, like a quiet mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An idea occurred to Biff. He dashed below. He was
back in a moment. He held out his hand to Dr. Weber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just remembered this, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the doctor&rsquo;s tobacco pouch and pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, my boy. Missing my pipe was the worst
torture I endured during my entire captivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout came from the side of the yawl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;You people up there still interested in a metal
box?&rdquo; It was the diver. &ldquo;Think this could be it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hawaiian diver held an oblong object above
his head. Biff leaned over the side and took it from his
hands. It was encrusted with barnacles, bits of shell,
and slimy green seaweed.</p>
<p>It was a metal box. Biff handed it to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a screwdriver, Biff. We&rsquo;ll have to pry the lid
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone watched tensely as Thomas Brewster
worked the screwdriver under the lid of the box. A
small lock held it shut. Finally, the lid sprang open.
Inside was a loose, dust-like substance, hardened in
spots where sea water had leaked in. There was also a
damp piece of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it. It&rsquo;s got to be. Take a look, Dr. Weber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor dipped his hand in the box. He fingered
the powdery substance. He nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell how this will run yet. I will have to test
it. But ... well, I think we&rsquo;ve really got something
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Brewster and Biff were pouring over the
map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The field&rsquo;s well marked. Won&rsquo;t be any trouble
locating it if this sample proves out to be high grade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor was looking at the pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, could you fly me back to Honolulu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Only take an hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom. I&rsquo;d like to get back to my hotel. All
my equipment is there. I can test this sample immediately.
I want to. Is it all right with you, Henry, if I
steal your plane and pilot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, doctor. We&rsquo;ll all go back to Hilo by
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, when you get there, look for a message
from me. I&rsquo;ll have run my tests long before you
can get back by boat. Then I&rsquo;m off. I&rsquo;m due at an
international scientific convention in Switzerland
early next week. I&rsquo;ll have to leave Honolulu before
you get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor shook hands all around. His last words
to the group were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for my pipe, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff grinned in reply. It was hard to believe that
this was the same old man who had been carried
aboard not long ago.</p>
<p>The doctor boarded the plane, and in five minutes
it was out of sight, winging its way to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Tom Brewster took the tiller of the <i>Easy Action</i>.
Li was at the anchor winch, Biff at the mainmast,
and Hank Mahenili at the mizzen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoist away,&rdquo; Tom Brewster sang out as he felt
the anchor pull free.</p>
<p>Sails rattled up their masts. The wind caught them,
and the <i>Easy Action</i> was put on a course for Hilo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>It was a pleasant sail. Everyone was relaxed. There
was little conversation. All were happy to loll about
the deck, resting from their recent near escapes from
violence and storm.</p>
<p>It was night by the time Mr. Brewster headed the
yawl for a dock in Hilo Bay. The boat was tied up,
and in half an hour, the party entered their hotel.</p>
<p>As good as his word, there was a message waiting
from Dr. Weber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sample proves out cesium in purest state discovered
thus far in world. Looks like a sky-blue find.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Brewster handed the message to Biff. Biff read
it and smiled at his father. &ldquo;Why sky-blue, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Weber&rsquo;s mild little joke. Cesium means &lsquo;sky-blue&rsquo;
because that is how it shows up on a spectrum
test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy and his father stood silent for a moment,
enjoying this moment of complete peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Biff said, &ldquo;this was supposed to be a vacation
for Mom and the twins. Can we still make it one
for the <i>whole</i> family? Have them fly over here and
explore this beautiful island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explore, Biff? Haven&rsquo;t you had enough adventure
for now? I&rsquo;ll have them come over. But for the rest
of our stay, it&rsquo;s going to be nothing but fun and
frolic. You agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check, Dad. Check.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Biff Brewster, sixteen, is a tall, strongly built
blond youth who lives In Indianapolis, Indiana,
with his parents and the eleven-year-old
twins, Ted and Monica. Because his
mother and father believe that travel is as
important to education as formal schooling,
Biff is encouraged to travel to various countries
during the vacation months. His experiences
in these lands, and the young people
he meets there, form the basis of a new series
for adventure-loving readers. In every journey
there is a strong element of mystery, usually a
direct result of conditions peculiar to the region
in which he is traveling. Thus, in addition
to adventure, these books impart carefully researched
information about foreign countries.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
